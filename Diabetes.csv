Globally, diabetes affects 537 million people, making it the deadliest and the most common non? communicable disease. Many factors can cause a person to get affected by diabetes, like excessive body weight, abnormal cholesterol level, family history, physical inactivity, bad food habit etc. Increased urination is one of the most common symptoms of this disease. People with diabetes for a long time can get several complications like heart disorder, kidney disease, nerve damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced if it is predicted early. In this paper, an automatic diabetes prediction system has been developed using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and various machine learning techniques. The authors used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and collected additional samples from 203 individuals from a local textile factory in Bangladesh. Feature selection algorithm mutual information has been applied in this work. A semi? supervised model with extreme gradient boosting has been utilized to predict the insulin features of the private dataset. SMOTE and ADASYN approaches have been employed to manage the class imbalance problem. The authors used machine learning classification methods, that is, decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and various ensemble techniques, to determine which algorithm produces the best prediction results. After training on and testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the best result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy, 0.81 F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system. The explainable AI approach with LIME and SHAP frameworks is implemented to understand how the model predicts the final results. Finally, a website framework and an Android smartphone application have been developed to input various features and predict diabetes instantaneously. This study aims to predict diabetes mellitus automatically by employing machine learning techniques. Pima Indian dataset and a new RTML dataset comprising physical examination data from the local female patients of Bangladesh have been used. The missing insulin feature values of the RTML dataset have been predicted from the Pima Indian dataset. Our research found that the XGB regression technique accomplished the lowest RMS error in predicting insulin. The mutual information? based feature selection algorithm indicates the glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin to be the most salient features in predicting diabetes. SMOTE and ADASYN synthetic data oversampling and hyperparameters optimization techniques have been applied. The XGBoost technique with ADASYN achieved the best performance. The LIME and SHAP explainable AI frameworks interpret the prediction provided by the ML approaches. A limitation of this study is the nonavailability of the insulin feature of the used RTML dataset. The prediction of insulin obtained from the XGB regressor and produced from the mean and median values of the Pima India dataset comprises an average deviation for classification accuracy of approximately 1.33% and 2.33%, respectively."

Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for diabetes diagnosis, but challenges such as limited labeled data, frequent missing values, and dataset imbalance hinder the development of accurate prediction models. Therefore, a novel framework is required to address these challenges and improve performance. In this study, we propose an innovative pipeline-based multi-classification framework to predict diabetes in three classes: diabetic, non-diabetic, and prediabetes, using the imbalanced Iraqi Patient Dataset of Diabetes. Our framework incorporates various pre-processing techniques, including duplicate sample removal, attribute conversion, missing value imputation, data normalization and standardization, feature selection, and k-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we implement multiple machine learning models, such as k-NN, SVM, DT, RF, AdaBoost, and GNB, and introduce a weighted ensemble approach based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to address dataset imbalance. Performance optimization is achieved through grid search and Bayesian optimization for hyper-parameter tuning.Our proposed model outperforms other machine learning models, including k-NN, SVM, DT, RF, AdaBoost, and GNB, in predicting diabetes. The model achieves high average accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC values of 0.9887, 0.9861, 0.9792, 0.9851, and 0.999, respectively. Our pipeline-based multi-classification framework demonstrates promising results in accurately predicting diabetes using an imbalanced dataset of Iraqi diabetic patients. The proposed framework addresses the challenges associated with limited labeled data, missing values, and dataset imbalance, leading to improved prediction performance. This study highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in diabetes diagnosis and management, and the proposed framework can serve as a valuable tool for accurate prediction and improved patient care. Further research can build upon our work to refine and optimize the framework and explore its applicability in diverse datasets and populations. Diabetes is a chronic condition that significantly impacts individuals' quality of life, underscoring the critical need for accurate prediction methods in its management and prevention. In our study, we delve into the analysis and interpretation of results obtained from our ensemble machine learning models, which were designed to predict diabetes using the IPDD dataset. We also explore the implications of our findings, discuss the limitations of our study, and provide recommendations for future research.The primary contribution of this research lies in introducing a introduces, pipeline-based framework of multi-class machine learning models for diabetes prediction. The framework utilizes the IPDD dataset, which encompasses three distinct groups: diabetic subjects (Y), non-diabetic subjects (N), and predicted diabetic subjects (P). The innovative nature of this framework lies in its ability to effectively classify individuals into these categories, thereby enhancing our understanding of diabetes prediction. This approach addresses the multi-class classification problem and ensures a comprehensive evaluation of performance by employing various evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of our proposed models. Data pre-processing plays a vital role in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of predictive models. In our proposed model, we utilized several pre-processing techniques, such as filling missing values, standardization, normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction. These techniques were implemented to meticulously prepare the data, improve model performance, and mitigate the impact of incomplete or inconsistent data. The results of our study emphasize the significance of data pre-processing in achieving accurate predictions for diabetes. By leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple individual classifiers, our ensemble approach demonstrates its effectiveness through improved overall performance and accuracy in diabetes prediction. This approach addresses biases and errors inherent in individual classifiers, which is particularly important given the challenges posed by imbalanced data and missing attribute values in diabetes prediction. Our experiments consistently showed that the random forest model, in combination with the MRMR and I?+?N stages of data pre-processing, outperformed other models. This highlights the importance of feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques in enhancing diabetes prediction accuracy. The utilization of MRMR feature selection and PCA/ICA dimensionality reduction methods enables the identification of key features that significantly impact class determination. Furthermore, combining K-NN, AB, DT, and RF models with 11 features and I pre-processing exhibited superior performance in predicting diabetes in the IPDD dataset. This underscores the significance of employing a diverse set of machine learning models in an ensemble approach to enhance prediction accuracy. By harnessing the strengths of these models, we achieve more robust and reliable predictions. It is important to note that the evaluation of our models was not solely based on accuracy due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. Instead, we employed multiple evaluation measures, including the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance. AUC is particularly suitable for imbalanced datasets as it considers the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate, offering a more accurate representation of the model's predictive power. Despite yielding promising results, our study has certain limitations. Firstly, the IPDD dataset used in our research may possess inherent biases and limitations that could affect the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Future studies should consider incorporating datasets from diverse patient populations to validate the effectiveness of our proposed models. Secondly, while we employed various data pre-processing techniques, there may be alternative approaches that could further optimize the performance of our models. Exploring alternative pre-processing techniques and comparing their efficacy could be a valuable avenue for future research. Ensemble models have their limitations, including increased model complexity, longer training and testing times, and the requirement of comprehensive data for model construction and configuration. Additionally, the interpretation of results from these models can be challenging due to their complexity across different datasets, potentially leading to inconclusive outcomes. Therefore, prior to utilizing these models, a meticulous examination and in-depth analysis of their features, data size, and other aspects are imperative."

Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), 22(19), 7268. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22197268",2022,"An Ensemble Approach for the Prediction of Diabetes Mellitus Using a Soft Voting Classifier with an Explainable AI. Diabetes is a chronic disease that continues to be a primary and worldwide health concern since the health of the entire population has been affected by it. Over the years, many academics have attempted to develop a reliable diabetes prediction model using machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, these research investigations have had a minimal impact on clinical practice as the current studies focus mainly on improving the performance of complicated ML models while ignoring their explainability to clinical situations. Therefore, the physicians find it difficult to understand these models and rarely trust them for clinical use. In this study, a carefully constructed, efficient, and interpretable diabetes detection method using an explainable AI has been proposed. The Pima Indian diabetes dataset was used, containing a total of 768 instances where 268 are diabetic, and 500 cases are non-diabetic with several diabetic attributes. Here, six machine learning algorithms (artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost) have been used along with an ensemble classifier to diagnose the diabetes disease. For each machine learning model, global and local explanations have been produced using the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), which are represented in different types of graphs to help physicians in understanding the model predictions. The balanced accuracy of the developed weighted ensemble model was 90% with a F1 score of 89% using a five-fold cross-validation (CV). The median values were used for the imputation of the missing values and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTETomek) was used to balance the classes of the dataset. The proposed approach can improve the clinical understanding of a diabetes diagnosis and help in taking necessary action at the very early stages of the disease. Based on several ML methods, this study provided an accurate and highly explainable ensemble model with the usage of the cross validation approach and by combining two ML algorithms (RF, XGB), using a weighted soft voting classifier to successfully predict the risk of diabetes. It was demonstrated that the predictions based on the weighted ensemble are significantly better than the individual algorithms. The system achieved the highest accuracies by selecting appropriate weights. An accuracy of 90% and a F1 score of 89% was achieved by the ensemble model and was highly competitive with the other models proposed in the literature. The missing value imputation by median values, and the data balancing by the SMOTETomek also contributed to the improved performance. Moreover, the proposed ensemble model produced a favorable accuracy-interpretability trade-off because it achieved accurate results and a high level of interpretability using the permutation importance and SHAP plots. The ensemble model provided logical, medically trustworthy, and practical judgment that can boost a physician’s confidence in real-life implementation.Even with encouraging findings from an academic perspective, the model is still much farther away from being utilized in a real-world medical scenario, which is intended to be carried out in future. Further studies are needed to assess the performance characteristics of the proposed approach in other relevant datasets. Further improvement in the model’s performance and explainability will be attempted using different ML algorithms to develop different types of ensemble models."

Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders, 21(1), 339–352. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-022-00981-w",2022,"Performance analysis and prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on lifestyle data using machine learning approaches. Objective: Diabetes is a chronic fatal disease that has affected millions of people all over the globe. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 90% of the affected population among all types of diabetes. Millions of T2DM patients remain undiagnosed due to lack of awareness and under resourced healthcare system. So, there is a dire need for a diagnostic and prognostic tool that shall help the healthcare providers, clinicians and practitioners with early prediction and hence can recommend the lifestyle changes required to stop the progression of diabetes. The main objective of this research is to develop a framework based on machine learning techniques using only lifestyle indicators for prediction of T2DM disease. Moreover, prediction model can be used without visiting clinical labs and hospital readmissions.
Method A proposed framework is presented and implemented based on machine learning paradigms using lifestyle indicators for better prediction of T2DM disease. The current research has involved different experts like Diabetologists, Endocrinologists, Dieticians, Nutritionists, etc. for selecting the contributing 1552 instances and 11 attributes lifestyle biological features to promote health and manage complications towards T2DM disease. The dataset has been collected through survey and google forms from different geographical regions. As far as current medical diagnosis and prognosis is concerned, it has been found that there is a radical increase in the rate of people suffering from all types of diabetes. There is a lack of medical facilities to cope up with unnecessary testing, treatment and readmission in hospitals globally. So for the better prediction of T2DM, an intelligent expert system that exploits machine learning techniques for providing better results through statistical measures has been proposed. In the proposed model, outliers and corrupted/noisy data have been removed and the missing values are being filled by standardization at the pre-processing stage. Then data wrangling has been done along with data standardization and K-fold cross-validation. Different classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB) were employed for model building. The experimental study shows that the accuracy of Gradient Boosting is 97.24% for training results and 96.90% for testing results which is the highest among all other classifiers. The GB model outperformed other classifiers in terms of other statistical measures like precision, recall, specificity, f1-score, etc. To extend the current study, these algorithms shall be used for different, large and real-time datasets to establish the efficacy of the proposed system. A complete package in the form of product can be developed for real-time predictions which uses knowledge generated by the system proposed at runtime. In consultation with the specialists of the domain biological contributing parameters can be incorporated if required for better results.
Results Seven machine learning classifiers were employed namely K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB). Gradient Boosting classifier outperformed best with an accuracy rate of 97.24% for training and 96.90% for testing separately followed by RF, DT, NB, SVM, LR, and KNN as 95.36%, 92.52%, 90.72%, 90.20%, 90.20% and 77.06% respectively. However, in terms of precision, RF achieved high performance (0.980%) and KNN performed the lowest (0.793%). As far as recall is being concerned, GB achieved the highest rate of 0.975% and KNN showed the worst rate of 0.774%. Also, GB is top performed in terms of f1-score. According to the ROCs, GB and NB had a better area under the curve compared to the others.
Conclusion The research developed a realistic health management system for T2DM disease based on machine learning techniques using only lifestyle data for prediction of T2DM. To extend the current study, these models shall be used for different, large and real-time datasets which share the commonality of data with T2DM disease to establish the efficacy of the proposed system."

Preventing chronic disease, 16, E130. https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd16.190109",2019,"Building Risk Prediction Models for Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Techniques. As one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, affects the health of millions of people and puts an enormous financial burden on the US economy. We aimed to develop predictive models to identify risk factors for type 2 diabetes, which could help facilitate early diagnosis and intervention and also reduce medical costs. We analyzed cross-sectional data on 138,146 participants, including 20,467 with type 2 diabetes, from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We built several machine learning models for predicting type 2 diabetes, including support vector machine, decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, neural network, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers. We used univariable and multivariable weighted logistic regression models to investigate the associations of potential risk factors with type 2 diabetes. All predictive models for type 2 diabetes achieved a high area under the curve (AUC), ranging from 0.7182 to 0.7949. Although the neural network model had the highest accuracy (82.4%), specificity (90.2%), and AUC (0.7949), the decision tree model had the highest sensitivity (51.6%) for type 2 diabetes. We found that people who slept 9 or more hours per day (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.25) or had checkup frequency of less than 1 year (aOR = 2.31, 95% CI, 1.86–2.85) had higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Of the 8 predictive models, the neural network model gave the best model performance with the highest AUC value; however, the decision tree model is preferred for initial screening for type 2 diabetes because it had the highest sensitivity and, therefore, detection rate. We confirmed previously reported risk factors and also identified sleeping time and frequency of checkup as 2 new potential risk factors related to type 2 diabetes. Although many predictive models for type 2 diabetes have been built, most studies have used logistic regression and Cox models (18). In this study, we built predictive models for type 2 diabetes using multiple machine learning algorithms, including SVM, decision tree, logistic regression, neural network, random forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. By comparing their prediction performance on the test data set, our predictive models showed similar performance in predicting type 2 diabetes in terms of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. However, the neural network prediction model had the highest accuracy, specificity, and AUC values. In contrast, the decision tree prediction model had the highest sensitivity. Other machine learning techniques have similar model performance to logistic regression for predicting type 2 diabetes (19). Although some predictive models performed even better in predicting type 2 diabetes in other studies, with the AUC reaching 0.9, these models were based on longitudinal data sets including clinical data, laboratory measurements, and biomarkers (18). Our decision tree prediction model solely based on national survey data had a 51.6% sensitivity/detection rate, which is an improvement over what was reported by Talmud, who found a sensitivity/detection rate of 30% to 40% using both survey data and biomarkers. Therefore, our models can provide reasonable initial population screening for type 2 diabetes at a lower data cost, and the decision tree prediction model is preferred because of its high sensitivity/detection rate. Our statistical analysis was able to confirm well-known risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as age and BMI, but more importantly may have identified new risk factors. Our analysis showed that not only under sleeping (?6 hours per day) but also over sleeping (?9 hours per day) increases risk for type 2 diabetes. It is well known that shorter sleep duration can lead to a higher risk for type 2 diabetes (20), and it has been linked to obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance (21–23). It has been reported that increases in sleeping time among middle-aged and older women could lead to modestly higher risks of diabetes (24,25). In this study, we demonstrated that the increased risk for type 2 diabetes due to over sleeping applies to all adults. It has been suggested that long sleeping time can have detrimental effects on general health (26), although the mechanism through which this might occur is unknown. The frequency of getting a checkup is another potential risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Our data showed that getting a checkup within 1 year or never having had checkup increases risk for type 2 diabetes. There are many factors that influence whether a person has a regular checkup. People with diabetes may see a doctor more frequently to monitor their condition, and the lack of a regular doctor visit may be an extension of an unhealthy lifestyle for others. In addition, those who do not have a regular checkup may experience barriers such as lack of transportation or not having health insurance. It is possible that people who do not get a regular checkup missed a possible diagnosis of prediabetes and therefore the opportunity of early intervention and the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Our study has limitations. Due to the cross-sectional nature of BRFSS data, we could not establish causality. An additional limitation is that BRFSS data were self-reported and subject to recall bias that could affect the performance of our predictive models. However, given the availability of clinical data and biomarkers, our predictive models may perform better in predicting type 2 diabetes. We used advanced machine learning techniques to construct predictive models for type 2 diabetes that had good sensitivity and specificity and that helped identify 2 new potential new risk factors for the disease. Our models and findings could allow for early detection, intervention, and prevention of type 2 diabetes."

Frontiers in genetics, 9, 515. https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2018.00515",2018,"Predicting Diabetes Mellitus With Machine Learning Techniques.  Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It may cause many complications. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the world’s diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which means that one of the ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes. There is no doubt that this alarming figure needs great attention. With the rapid development of machine learning, machine learning has been applied to many aspects of medical health. In this study, we used decision tree, random forest and neural network to predict diabetes mellitus. The dataset is the hospital physical examination data in Luzhou, China. It contains 14 attributes. In this study, five-fold cross validation was used to examine the models. In order to verity the universal applicability of the methods, we chose some methods that have the better performance to conduct independent test experiments. We randomly selected 68994 healthy people and diabetic patients’ data, respectively as training set. Due to the data unbalance, we randomly extracted 5 times data. And the result is the average of these five experiments. In this study, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) to reduce the dimensionality. The results showed that prediction with random forest could reach the highest accuracy (ACC = 0.8084) when all the attributes were used. Diabetes mellitus is a disease, which can cause many complications. How to exactly predict and diagnose this disease by using machine learning is worthy studying. According to the all above experiments, we found the accuracy of using PCA is not good, and the results of using the all features and using mRMR have better results. The result, which only used fasting glucose, has a better performance especially in Luzhou dataset. It means that the fasting glucose is the most important index for predict, but only using fasting glucose cannot achieve the best result, so if want to predict accurately, we need more indexes. In addition, by comparing the results of three classifications, we can find there is not much difference among random forest, decision tree and neural network, but random forests are obviously better than the another classifiers in some methods. The best result for Luzhou dataset is 0.8084, and the best performance for Pima Indians is 0.7721, which can indicate machine learning can be used for prediction diabetes, but finding suitable attributes, classifier and data mining method are very important. Due to the data, we cannot predict the type of diabetes, so in future we aim to predicting type of diabetes and exploring the proportion of each indicator, which may improve the accuracy of predicting diabetes."

International journal of environmental research and public health, 19(22), 15027. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215027",2022,"Machine Learning Models for Data-Driven Prediction of Diabetes by Lifestyle Type. The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing in recent years, and previous research has found that machine-learning models are good diabetes prediction tools. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of five different machine-learning models for diabetes prediction using lifestyle data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. The 1999–2020 NHANES database yielded data on 17,833 individuals data based on demographic characteristics and lifestyle-related variables. To screen training data for machine models, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) forward propagation algorithm was utilized. For predicting diabetes, five machine-learning models (CATBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) were developed. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Among the five machine-learning models, the dietary intake levels of energy, carbohydrate, and fat, contributed the most to the prediction of diabetes patients. In terms of model performance, CATBoost ranks higher than RF, LG, XGBoost, and SVM. The best-performing machine-learning model among the five is CATBoost, which achieves an accuracy of 82.1% and an AUC of 0.83. Machine-learning models based on NHANES data can assist medical institutions in identifying diabetes patients. Using five machine-learning models (CATBoost, XGBoost, RF, LR, and SVM), we attempted to predict diabetes based on lifestyle-related variables. We preprocessed the input data before training the model and used the mean to impute data with <5% missing values. In addition, we used SMOTE-NC to class-balance the data (the number of negative samples was much larger than the number of positive samples) to prevent the machine-learning model from outputting a single negative conclusion when making predictions when our dataset is class-imbalanced. Ultimately, we found that the performance ranking of the five machine-learning models was CATBoost > RF > LR > XGBoost > SVM. CATBoost has the best performance indicators among the five machine-learning models, with an AUC of 0.83 and an accuracy rate of 82.1%. Therefore, CATBoost may be employed as the best model for diabetes prediction for individuals in the prediction of machine-learning models based on or even modality variables. Previous studies have attempted to build machine-learning models for predicting diabetes. However, most previous studies employed random forests, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and other machine learning models based on bagging algorithms to predict diabetes . For example, built a diabetes prediction model for adolescents using logistic regression and Gradient Boosted Tree and finally obtained a machine-learning model with an RUC of 71%. Krishnamoorthi . An intelligent framework for diabetes prediction was constructed by applying four machine learning methods, with an RUC of 0.8 and final prediction accuracy of 83%. Although previous researchers have achieved good model results, few machine learning models for diabetes prediction based on the Boosting algorithm are still few. For example, Kumar et al. used CatBoost, logistic regression, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks to predict the probability of diabetes in gestational women and finally got an AUC of 0.86. Zhang et al. used logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and Catboost and Xgboost to predict childhood insulin resistance and obtained an AUC of 0.85. Using the Boosting algorithm to develop a model can better solve the problem of gradient bias and prediction offset, thereby reducing the occurrence of overfitting and improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the algorithm. Compared with previous studies, our study optimized the previous researchers’ diabetes prediction model, which achieved higher AUC and accuracy rates on easy access to characteristic variables. As characteristic factors in our study, we selected demographics data and 18 lifestyle data from NHANES. Gender, age, race, country of birth, education level, poverty ratio, BMI, energy, protein, carbohydrates, sugar, total fat, cholesterol, smoking status, sleep duration, alcohol consumption, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were among them. Most previous researchers included biochemical indicators as an essential variable in their diabetes-prediction models. Lifestyle-related indicators have better collectability and de-aggression than biomarkers. Therefore, the model we established is independent of biochemical indicators, and our goal is to construct a practical and user-friendly screening model. Figure depicts the relative importance of various variables, which is consistent with past reports, with sleep duration, daily nutrient intake (such as energy, carbohydrates, fat, etc.), and age being the most important variables influencing model design. Furthermore, according to Civeira’s research, age ranks third in feature importance as an essential demographic variable.
In the diabetes domain, diabetes datasets are often class-imbalanced datasets (a large number of people without diabetes and a small number of people with diabetes). Therefore, in contrast to earlier studies, we employed the SMOTE-NC method to deal with imbalanced class data. In contrast to prior research that did not use class imbalanced data, our machine-learning model could reduce missing and misdiagnosis rates. In addition, having too many variables in the model makes it heavy and slow. The significant increase in the data dimension will in-crease the complexity of the classification model, as well as the phenomenon of overfitting. Feature selection plays an important role in traditional and deep machine learning. Thus we utilized the quantifiable AIC forward propagation metric to filter the variables and eliminate the variables that contributed the least to the model. In the future, our research will be more inclined to the field of deep learning, combining big data samples with deep learning models. In addition, we will further increase the sample size and strive to optimize the model further to have better model prediction performance."

Diabetes care, 25(11), 1999–2003. https://doi.org/10.2337/diacare.25.11.1999",2002,"A Multivariate Logistic Regression Equation to Screen for Diabetes : Development and validation. OBJECTIVE To develop and validate an empirical equation to screen for diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A predictive equation was developed using multiple logistic regression analysis and data collected from 1,032 Egyptian subjects with no history of diabetes. The equation incorporated age, sex, BMI, postprandial time (self-reported number of hours since last food or drink other than water), and random capillary plasma glucose as independent covariates for prediction of undiagnosed diabetes. These covariates were based on a fasting plasma glucose level ?126 mg/dl and/or a plasma glucose level 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load ?200 mg/dl. The equation was validated using data collected from an independent sample of 1,065 American subjects. Its performance was also compared with that of recommended and proposed static plasma glucose cut points for diabetes screening. RESULTS—The predictive equation was calculated with the following logistic regression parameters: P = 1/(1 ? e?x), where x = ?10.0382 + [0.0331 (age in years) + 0.0308 (random plasma glucose in mg/dl) + 0.2500 (postprandial time assessed as 0 to ?8 h) + 0.5620 (if female) + 0.0346 (BMI)]. The cut point for the prediction of previously undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a probability value ?0.20. The equation’s sensitivity was 65%, specificity 96%, and positive predictive value (PPV) 67%. When applied to a new sample, the equation’s sensitivity was 62%, specificity 96%, and PPV 63%. CONCLUSIONS—This multivariate logistic equation improves on currently recommended methods of screening for undiagnosed diabetes and can be easily implemented in a inexpensive handheld programmable calculator to predict previously undiagnosed diabetes. The performance of all screening tests depends on the cut points used to define a positive test. The choice of a higher cut point leaves more cases undetected, and the choice of a lower cut point classifies more healthy individuals as abnormal. Currently, there are no widely accepted or rigorously validated cut points to define positive screening tests for diabetes in nonpregnant adults. The ADA has recommended a random capillary whole blood glucose cut point of ?140 mg/dl (capillary plasma glucose ?160 mg/dl), and Rolka et al. have recommended a random capillary plasma glucose cut point of ?120 mg/dl. Optimal cut points for random capillary glucose tests depend on age, sex, BMI, and postprandial time. Multivariate equations incorporate multiple pieces of diagnostic information and can provide a flexible alternative to static cut points for the definition of a positive test. We have developed a multivariate predictive equation based on age, sex, BMI, postprandial time, and capillary plasma glucose levels to assess the likelihood of previously undiagnosed diabetes. The equation was 65% sensitive and 96% specific. In validation testing, the equation was 62% sensitive and 96% specific. Predictive equations rarely perform as well with new data as with the data with which they were developed because during development, the equation maximizes the probability of predicting the values in the original dataset. When testing an equation, the important factor is the size of the decrement in performance. The relatively small decrement in sensitivity and unchanged specificity suggest that the equation has both external validity and generalizability. A decision regarding acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity involves weighting the consequences of leaving cases undetected (false negatives) and classifying healthy individuals as abnormal (false positives). Like the ADA-recommended plasma glucose cut point of 160 mg/dl, the logistic equation provided high specificity (96%). Compared with the ADA-recommended cut point of 160 mg/dl, the logistic equation improved sensitivity (44 and 63%, respectively). Compared with the plasma glucose cut point of 120 mg/dl, the logistic equation improved specificity (77 and 96%, respectively) but was less sensitive (76 and 63%, respectively). Highly specific screening tests minimize the number of false-positive results but increase the number of false-negative results. They are preferable if the failure to make an early diagnosis and initiate treatment does not have dire health consequences, if a disease is uncommon in the population, and if false-positive results can harm the subject physically, emotionally, or financially. Type 2 diabetes is often slowly progressive and is not associated with complications in the short term. Individuals with initial false-negative screening tests will be identified as abnormal on rescreening, particularly if they have progressive glucose intolerance. In addition, undiagnosed diabetes is uncommon: in a representative sample of the U.S. population 40–74 years of age, undiagnosed diabetes, defined by FPG ?140 mg/dl or 2-h PG ?200, was present in only 6.7%. False-positive screening tests require further diagnostic tests that are inconvenient, expensive, and time-consuming. For these reasons, we believe that the predictive equation, which is highly specific, is preferable to a static glucose cut point of 120 mg/dl, which is much less specific. We also believe that the predictive equation is preferable to a static glucose cut point of 160 mg/dl because, given comparable high specificity, it is much more sensitive. PPV and OAPR are measures of the performance of a diagnostic test that depend on the prevalence of the disease in the screened population and on the sensitivity and specificity of the test. However, unlike sensitivity and specificity, they are not properties of the screening test itself, but of its application. The multivariate predictive equation provided a PPV of 64% and an OAPR of 1.75. These results were better than those obtained with all static plasma glucose cut points <180 mg/dl and indicate that among those with a positive test, 64% actually have diabetes (true positives), and the odds of having a true-positive test result are 1.75 times greater than the odds of having a false-positive result. Tests with an OAPR <1 identify fewer true positives than false positives."

Chronic diseases and translational medicine, 8(4), 281–295. https://doi.org/10.1002/cdt3.39",2022,"Integrated statistical and machine learning analysis provides insight into key influencing symptoms for distinguishing early?onset type 2 diabetes. Background Being able to predict with confidence the early onset of type 2 diabetes from a suite of signs and symptoms (features) displayed by potential sufferers is desirable to commence treatment promptly. Late or inconclusive diagnosis can result in more serious health consequences for sufferers and higher costs for health care services in the long run.
Methods A novel integrated methodology is proposed involving correlation, statistical analysis, machine learning, multi?K?fold cross?validation, and confusion matrices to provide a reliable classification of diabetes?positive and ?negative individuals from a substantial suite of features. The method also identifies the relative influence of each feature on the diabetes diagnosis and highlights the most important ones. Ten statistical and machine learning methods are utilized to conduct the analysis.
Results A published data set involving 520 individuals (Sylthet Diabetes Hospital, Bangladesh) is modeled revealing that a support vector classifier generates the most accurate early?onset type 2 diabetes status predictions with just 11 misclassifications (2.1% error). Polydipsia and polyuria are among the most influential features, whereas obesity and age are assigned low weights by the prediction models.
Conclusion The proposed methodology can rapidly predict early?onset type 2 diabetes with high confidence while providing valuable insight into the key influential features involved in such predictions. Further insight into some of the prediction models can be gained by considering information that indicates the relative importance of each of the signs and symptoms to the model solutions. Such information can be gleaned from the LGR model by considering the absolute magnitudes of its regression coefficients, from the SVC model by considering the absolute magnitudes of its support vector coefficients, and for the tree/ensemble?tree models (ADA, DT, RF, XGB) by considering their Gini (or entropy) coefficients. Unfortunately, it is not possible to extract such information from the NBC, QDA, KNN, and MLP models.
The relative importance of each variable in should be compared to their correlations with the diabetes diagnosis. It is apparent that polydipsia is given more weight by all of the models considered in Figure than other signs or symptoms, even though polyuria has a higher correlation with the type 2 diabetes status of the 520 individuals collectively. Polyuria and gender are the next most important criteria for most of the models compared. On the other hand, sudden weight loss, weakness, polyphagia, visual blurring, and partial paresis are not assigned substantial weights despite having moderate correlation coefficients (about +0.2 to +0.4;  with type 2 diabetes status.
The DT model stands out in that it assigns a more substantial weight (about 40% of the total weight it assigns) to polydipsia than the other models displayed. The ADA and XGB models also assign relatively high weights to polydipsia. The relative weights assigned by the regression models LGR and SVC are quite similar in magnitude and quite distinct from those assigned by the tree/ensemble models. For instance, those two models assign comparable weights to gender, polyuria, polydipsia, itching, and irritability, at levels that are distinct from the other models. The RF model assigns weights that tend, for the most part, to fall between those of the other ensemble methods and the SVC/LGR models. It is noticeable that obesity and age are assigned relatively low weights by all models.
Although the SVM and LGR models assign similar weights to most of the signs and symptoms they perform quite differently in their abilities to predict diabetes status. The SVM model performs much better than the LGR model. This is most likely explained in terms of the different mathematical concepts underpinning those two models. Whereas LGR is a binary, categorical classification model applying linear relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable, SVC combines linear computations, associated with the definition of its optimum hyperplane, and nonlinear relationships associated with its RBF kernel used to locate that hyperplane. It appears that the nonlinear aspect of the RBF component of the SVM model provides it with a substantial advantage over the linear LGR model in type 2 diabetes status predictions when applied to the studied data set.
Establishing distinct influences and relative importance of the signs and symptoms of the high?performing prediction models is important information to ascertain for two reasons. Firstly, it helps focus a clinician's attention on the key signs and symptoms to look for in type 2 diabetes screening. Secondly, it suggests that using one or other model, or correlation coefficients, to conduct feature selection to limit the number of signs and symptoms to input to other prediction models is probably not a good idea. Each feature exerts a different influence oneach of the prediction models, therefore it is risky to disregard any of them. For instance, the “itching” criterion is assigned a low weight by the tree/ensemble methods and has a low correlation with diabetes status, yet it is assigned a relatively high 10% weight by the SVC and LGR models.
Although the SVC, RF, MLP, and XGB models perform well with the Sylhet?520 data set evaluated, further study is required to be able to generalize these models for application to other datasets involving larger numbers of individuals and broader geographic areas. One issue is the significance of weights assigned by the models to individual age and gender as influential variables. If these variables are to be used for larger datasets, it is important to ensure that the age and gender distributions of the individuals tested, and percentages of type 2 diabetes?positive and type 2 diabetes?negative individuals represented, are comparable with those observed in the region/nation being evaluated. The Sylhet?520 is somewhat skewed in this regard. For instance, of the 192 females represented in the data set 173 are diabetes?positive (90%), and of the 328 males represented in the data set 147 are diabetes?positive (45%). Hence, correlations between gender and diabetes status established for the Sylhet?520 data set are not likely to be meaningful when applied to other data sets."

Machine Learning-Derived Prenatal Predictive Risk Model to Guide Intervention and Prevent the Progression of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus to Type 2 Diabetes: Prediction Model Development Study. JMIR diabetes, 7(3), e32366. https://doi.org/10.2196/32366",2022,"Machine Learning–Derived Prenatal Predictive Risk Model to Guide Intervention and Prevent the Progression of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus to Type 2 Diabetes: Prediction Model Development Study. The increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is concerning as women with GDM are at high risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) later in life. The magnitude of this risk highlights the importance of early intervention to prevent the progression of GDM to T2D. Rates of postpartum screening are suboptimal, often as low as 13% in Asian countries. The lack of preventive care through structured postpartum screening in several health care systems and low public awareness are key barriers to postpartum diabetes screening. In this study, we developed a machine learning model for early prediction of postpartum T2D following routine antenatal GDM screening. The early prediction of postpartum T2D during prenatal care would enable the implementation of effective strategies for diabetes prevention interventions. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that uses machine learning for postpartum T2D risk assessment in antenatal populations of Asian origin. Prospective multiethnic data (Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnicities) from 561 pregnancies in Singapore’s most deeply phenotyped mother-offspring cohort study—Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes—were used for predictive modeling. The feature variables included were demographics, medical or obstetric history, physical measures, lifestyle information, and GDM diagnosis. Shapley values were combined with CatBoost tree ensembles to perform feature selection. Our game theoretical approach for predictive analytics enables population subtyping and pattern discovery for data-driven precision care. The predictive models were trained using 4 machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, CatBoost gradient boosting, and artificial neural network. We used 5-fold stratified cross-validation to preserve the same proportion of T2D cases in each fold. Grid search pipelines were built to evaluate the best performing hyperparameters. Results A high performance prediction model for postpartum T2D comprising of 2 midgestation features—midpregnancy BMI after gestational weight gain and diagnosis of GDM—was developed (BMI_GDM CatBoost model: AUC=0.86, 95% CI 0.72-0.99). Prepregnancy BMI alone was inadequate in predicting postpartum T2D risk (ppBMI CatBoost model: AUC=0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.86). A 2-hour postprandial glucose test (BMI_2hour CatBoost model: AUC=0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.96) showed a stronger postpartum T2D risk prediction effect compared to fasting glucose test (BMI_Fasting CatBoost model: AUC=0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.91). The BMI_GDM model was also robust when using a modified 2-point International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) 2018 criteria for GDM diagnosis (BMI_GDM2 CatBoost model: AUC=0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.97). Total gestational weight gain was inversely associated with postpartum T2D outcome, independent of prepregnancy BMI and diagnosis of GDM (P=.02; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98). Conclusions Midgestation weight gain effects, combined with the metabolic derangements underlying GDM during pregnancy, signal future T2D risk in Singaporean women. Further studies will be required to examine the influence of metabolic adaptations in pregnancy on postpartum maternal metabolic health outcomes. The state-of-the-art machine learning model can be leveraged as a rapid risk stratification tool during prenatal care. We have built an effective postpartum T2D predictive model by combining game theory–based feature selection with machine learning. SHAP values recovered predictive modeling features for optimal performance, aligning model interpretability with human intuition. Our BMI_GDM model achieved an excellent AUC of 0.86 with 2 midgestation features (BMI at midgestation and diagnosis of GDM by the WHO 1999 criteria) for an early prediction of postpartum T2D risk in a Singapore population. The model was also robust when using a modified 2-point IADPSG 2018 criteria for GDM diagnosis (AUC=0.84). The BMI_GDM machine learning model can be leveraged as a risk stratification tool during routine GDM screening to identify Asian women at high risk of developing T2D, enabling early intervention. The BMI_2hour model (AUC=0.86) can be an alternative design during clinical implementation if GDM diagnosis feature is unavailable for the patient. The trained classifier can be deployed using a web application that can allow clinicians to identify women at T2D risk and develop a postpartum management plan. The 2-feature midpregnancy BMI model (AUC=0.86) performed better in postpartum T2D prediction than a preconception BMI model (AUC=0.62), implying that midgestational weight gain effects combined with the metabolic derangements underlying GDM and fetoplacental unit signal future T2D risk. As pregnancy has a diabetogenic effect on metabolism [13], further studies will be required to examine the metabolic adaptations in pregnancy and postpartum maternal metabolic health outcomes. In our BMI_GDM model sensitivity analysis, we observed that the 2-hour antenatal OGTT glucose peak was associated with a stronger prediction of postpartum T2D (AUC=0.86) compared with the fasting glucose (AUC=0.76) in Singaporean women. Future studies with greater statistical power will be needed to confirm whether the postpartum T2D risk is heterogenous across different thresholds of glucose tolerance for GDM diagnostic criteria. This study has some limitations due to the scarcity of longitudinal data. Postpartum OGTT at 4-12 weeks, and further testing in those with normal postpartum OGTT every 1-3 years were not administered in the GUSTO study, possibly underestimating the development of postdelivery dysglycemia to a certain extent and inducing bias. However, the mothers participating in GUSTO self-reported T2D status 2 years after delivery, and there were no self-reported T2D cases. Our prediction models were trained on a limited cohort of 561 pregnancies and require further validation using larger cohorts such as Electronic Health Record databases. A subcohort analyses by individual ethnic groups can be trained with larger data sets."

Frontiers in public health, 10, 1000622. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1000622",2022,"Development and assessment of novel machine learning models to predict medication non-adherence risks in type 2 diabetics. Background. Medication adherence is the main determinant of effective management of type 2 diabetes, yet there is no gold standard method available to screen patients with high-risk non-adherence. Developing machine learning models to predict high-risk non-adherence in patients with T2D could optimize management.
Methods. This cross-sectional study was carried out on patients with T2D at the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital from April 2018 to December 2019 who were examined for HbA1c on the day of the survey. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the questionnaire and electronic medical records. The sample was randomly divided into a training dataset and a test dataset with a radio of 8:2 after data preprocessing. Four imputing methods, five sampling methods, three screening methods, and 18 machine learning algorithms were used to groom data and develop and validate models. Bootstrapping was performed to generate the validation set for external validation and univariate analysis. Models were compared on the basis of predictive performance metrics. Finally, we validated the sample size on the best model. Results. This study included 980 patients with T2D, of whom 184 (18.8%) were defined as medication non-adherence. The results indicated that the model used modified random forest as the imputation method, random under sampler as the sampling method, Boruta as the feature screening method and the ensemble algorithms and had the best performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1 score, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of the best model, among a total of 1,080 trained models, were 0.8369, 0.7912, and 0.9574, respectively. Age, present fasting blood glucose (FBG) values, present HbA1c values, present random blood glucose (RBG) values, and body mass index (BMI) were the most significant contributors associated with risks of medication adherence. Conclusion. We found that machine learning methods could be used to predict the risk of non-adherence in patients with T2D. The proposed model was well performed to identify patients with T2D with non-adherence and could help improve individualized T2D management. Early detection of non-adherence to medication in patients with T2D will help devise strategies for personalized treatment. In this research, we developed a total of 1,080 models for the prediction of adherence in patients with T2D. The AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUPRC of the best model were 0.8369, 0.9474, 0.6792, 0.7912, and 0.9574, respectively. Meanwhile, various methods in model development and variables were validated by univariate analyses. Interestingly, the imputing method, the sampling method, the variable selection method, and the machine learning algorithm applied in the best model were the same as the results of univariate analysis. Additionally, variables with high importance scores in the best model were similar to the results of variable validation, which provided a positive contribution to the model prediction.
The adherence to the medication of patients with T2D has received great attention worldwide. Nonadherence is associated with bad outcomes, including increased mortality and avoidable healthcare costs. Previous studies reported models to predict drug non-adherence in Crohn's disease maintenance therapy, patients with hypertension, and patients with heart failure. However, few studies reported on prediction models of non-adherence to medication in patients with T2D. Intelligence technology is becoming more prevalent in healthcare as a tool to improve practice patterns and patient outcomes. With technology development, ensemble models have been commonly used to explore disease progression in the field of molecular biology. Recently, the ensemble algorithm has been frequently applied to develop prediction models. In our prior study, we reported that the ensemble algorithm was superior to the Bayesian network, KNN, SVM, C&R Tree, and CHAID. In this study, we added more machine learning classifications, including XGBoost, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, SGD, etc. Additionally, the ensemble algorithm was still the best.
Many variables have previously been reported to associate with drug adherence, such as age, population, level of education, etc. For example, according to the data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) of Korea, adherence consistently increased as the age increased until 69 years and started to decrease from the age of 70 years. When the same number of drugs was taken, the proportion of adherent patients according to age featured an inverted U-shape with a peak at 60–69 years. Additionally, Aditama et al.stated that the factors influencing non-adherence included complex instructions for taking medication, the absence of a reminder, the unwanted side effects of the drug, feeling of repetition, feeling that the drugs were ineffective, and concern for the effects of the drug on the kidney. Therefore, more patient-related and drug-related variables were considered in this study, including the number of comorbid diseases, EQ-5D scores, number of oral drugs, use of other types of drugs, and so on.
The results of the univariate analysis suggested that more variables can improve the accuracy of the prediction model (AUC = 0.063, P < 0.001). In clinical research, more variables mean collecting more data and increasing the missing data. Thus, feature selection plays an important role in the field of machine learning. In this study, no screening (marked as Not), Boruta, and LassoCV were performed. Boruta is a feature selection algorithm to identify the minimal set of relevant variables, which was applied in the best model. According to the variable importance score, the ten most important variables were age, present FBG values, present HbA1c values, present RBG values, BMI, duration of the treatment regimen, interval of measurement, waistline, weight, and course of diabetes. Glycemic control in patients with T2D can be accessed via the following three key parameters: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), FBG, and RBG. The results of variable importance demonstrated that patients with non-adherence should strongly encourage to monitor their blood glucose and receive reinforced education."

Objective. Medication adherence plays a key role in type 2 diabetes (T2D) care. Identifying patients with high risks of non-compliance helps individualized management, especially for China, where medical resources are relatively insufficient. However, models with good predictive capabilities have not been studied. This study aims to assess multiple machine learning algorithms and screen out a model that can be used to predict patients’ non-adherence risks. A real-world registration study was conducted at Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital from 1 April 2018 to 30 March 2019. Data of patients with T2D on demographics, disease and treatment, diet and exercise, mental status, and treatment adherence were obtained by face-to-face questionnaires. The medication possession ratio was used to evaluate patients’ medication adherence status. Fourteen machine learning algorithms were applied for modeling, including Bayesian network, Neural Net, support vector machine, and so on, and balanced sampling, data imputation, binning, and methods of feature selection were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We use two-way cross-validation to ensure the accuracy of model evaluation, and we performed a posteriori test on the sample size based on the trend of AUC as the sample size increase. A total of 401 patients out of 630 candidates were investigated, of which 85 were evaluated as poor adherence (21.20%). A total of 16 variables were selected as potential variables for modeling, and 300 models were built based on 30 machine learning algorithms. Among these algorithms, the AUC of the best capable one was 0.866±0.082. Imputing, oversampling and larger sample size will help improve predictive ability. An accurate and sensitive adherence prediction model based on real-world registration data was established after evaluating data filling, balanced sampling, and so on, which may provide a technical tool for individualized diabetes care. The development of patient’s medication adherence predictive models facilitates individualized diabetes education and care. In our research, 30 machine learning-based modeling algorithms were developed for adherence prediction, which at most 16 variables were used to build the model. After examining data filling, sampling, binning, and variable screening methods, the best algorithm, whose mean AUC was 0.866±0.082, was selected. The model was validated by sensitivity, specificity, and overfitting risk, and excellent predictive capability was shown to identify non-adherence patients. Although studies related to medication adherence predictive models are found in tuberculosis and heart failure, few studies have been retrieved that established and examined the predictive models in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), for whom medication adherence is a key factor to treatment outcomes. Kumamaru H et al established a logistic regression model for the prediction of future drug compliance. In their study, the patient’s current drug dependence characteristic played the role of the main predictor. Data from 90?000 patients were analyzed in the study. However, the AUC of their model was 0.666 (95% CI 0.661 to 0.671), which was smaller than ours (0.866±0.082). That may be because they focused on patients newly initiating statins, used retrospective data and evaluated fewer variables while we focused on a smaller population (patients with T2DM), conducted a prospective study and examined more targeted variables. The proportion of patients with good adherence in this study is 78.8%, which is comparable to data from Ethiopia (70.5%), the USA (70.0%) and white patients who were newly prescribed diabetes medications (62.5%). A systematic review showed that the rate of adherence to oral hypoglycemic agents ranged from 36%–93%?and 62%–64% to insulin in patients with T2DM.  Twenty-seven percent of Palestine refugees who have diabetes living in Jordan were not adherent to their regimens. Many variables are reportedly considered to be related to patient medication compliance such as gender, dyslipidemia, medication, and so on. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the factors and develop predictive models based on the factors such as the duration of the current medication regimen, whether the last fasting blood glucose was under control, and whether a reasonable diet plan had been implemented. Data filling is an important way to solve data loss problems that frequently appear in real-world studies. Every record needs a value for each variable during the multivariate analysis process in spite of missing data are inevitable in real-world data sets. Deleting the entire patient’s record due to small parts of data missing will result in a large amount of information loss. It could be necessary to delete the variables and records under severe missing circumstances (eg, more than 70% of data missing) to reduce noise in the whole data. However, there is still no consensus about whether the absence of the remaining data should be filled or how to perform effective data padding. Several studies have reported interpolation methods under the situation of data missing. Specially, multiple imputation (MI) methods are a wonderful approach to handle data missing issues for the consideration of the imputation uncertainty. MI generates m data sets, obtains results from each data set and combines m results at the last step. In this study, 300 models were built by using one data set and one algorithm was selected for use. We have not figured out how to combine m×300 models and find one algorithm out. So we used simple imputation here. The results of our study showed that the predictive abilities of moles were significantly improved (p<0.0001) after data filling. Univariate and multivariate analyses also showed that the increase in the available sample size would significantly enhance the models’ predictive performances which maybe also partly due to data imputation. Undersampling and oversampling are the main methods used to solve the issues that result from sample imbalance which also frequently happen in medical-related research data, such as the occurrence of adverse reactions and non-adverse reactions. Undersampling reduces the number of samples at the level of more samples while oversampling increases the number of samples at the level of fewer samples. Overestimation of AUC may occur on account of oversampling because of the existence of a large number of duplicate samples and some records are used to test the model after being used to train the model. Therefore, in this study, the data partitioning process was designed twice to produce a non-repeating set of verification samples, which is set 2, in order to ensure the credibility of the results. In addition, this study shows that oversampling is a key measure to improve predictive sensitivity and specificity (p<0.0001). There are several innovations in this study. First, we are more focused on collecting and evaluating variables that may be relevant to medication compliance in the real-world environment, which may increase the prediction accuracy of the model based on a limited sample size. Second, the model with the best prediction effect was found based on as many as 300 models built according to a variety of data processing methods and ten times randomly partitioning of data. Finally, we have innovatively tried a sample size posterior verification method based on the relative relationship between sample size and AUC, which can provide a reference for sample size analysis of predictive studies. However, limitations also exist in this study. First, in the sample size verification results, there is no inflection point in the AUC curve as the sample size increases, indicating that there is still a need for a further increase in the sample size. The second one is that we need to work with more centers to collect more data to optimize the model and verify the applicability of the model in healthcare facilities. Lastly, although we classified the patients’ last test results to reduce accuracy, for some variables, recall bias still exists."

Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are two of the main causes of death in the United States. Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression. We evaluate the capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using survey data (and laboratory results), and identify key variables within the data contributing to these diseases among the patients. Our research explores data-driven approaches which utilize supervised machine learning models to identify patients with such diseases. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and diabetes detection. Using different time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models.
Results. The developed ensemble model for cardiovascular disease (based on 131 variables) achieved an Area Under - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) score of 83.1% using no laboratory results, and 83.9% accuracy with laboratory results. In diabetes classification (based on 123 variables), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model achieved an AU-ROC score of 86.2% (without laboratory data) and 95.7% (with laboratory data). For pre-diabetic patients, the ensemble model had the top AU-ROC score of 73.7% (without laboratory data), and for laboratory based data XGBoost performed the best at 84.4%. Top five predictors in diabetes patients were 1) waist size, 2) age, 3) self-reported weight, 4) leg length, and 5) sodium intake. For cardiovascular diseases the models identified 1) age, 2) systolic blood pressure, 3) self-reported weight, 4) occurrence of chest pain, and 5) diastolic blood pressure as key contributors. Conclusion. We conclude machine learned models based on survey questionnaire can provide an automated identification mechanism for patients at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We also identify key contributors to the prediction, which can be further explored for their implications on electronic health records. Diabetic Prediction Models trained on diabetic patients (Case I) generally obtain a higher predictive power (86.2%) when compared to the Case II models which has a highest recorded accuracy of 73.7%. The decrease in detection performance in comparison to Case I is primarily due to two factors — 1) smaller number of observations, and 2) boundary conditions for the recorded observations. Case II only has 16,426 observations available in comparison to 21,091 observations available in Case I. The model also has difficulty in discerning fringe cases of patients, i.e. patients who are borderline diabetic versus normal. The accuracy also decreases slightly (AU-ROC at 72.5% for XGBoost) for the time-frame of 2003-2014, where there are even lower number of observations available for a larger number of variables. The consistency of the precision, recall, and F1 values suggests stable models with similar predictive power for diabetic (label=1) and non-diabetic (normal label=0) patients. The WEM and XGBoost models developed in the study surpass prior research done by Yu et al. [13] where they obtained 83.5% (Case I) and 73.2% (Case II) using non-linear SVM models. While the number of observations and additional feature variables play a key part in the increased accuracy of our models, the ensemble based model consistently out-performed SVM in the diabetic study (especially for Case I). Comparing time-frames within our data, we observe for the window of 2003-2014 the best performing model (RFC) had a lower AU-ROC score was at 84.1% for Case I. While the timeframe has a larger set of features (168 versus 123), the drop in the number of observations (16,443 versus 21,091) leads to the reduction in accuracy by 2% when compared to 1999-2014. Similar results are also observed in Case II where the AU-ROC drops by 1.2% as a result of decrease in the number from 16,446 (in 1999-2014) to 12,636 (in 2003-2014). Inclusion of laboratory results in Case I (1999-2014 timeframe) resulted in substantial increase the predictive capabilities (AU-ROC score of XGBoost - 95.7%). Contrary to previous observations, in the timeframe of 2003-2014, accuracy increases to 96.2% with XGBoost performing the best. This suggests availability of key laboratory variables within the 2003-2014 timeframe, leading to increased accuracy. Case II performance analysis with the laboratory variables also results in a large performance increase to AU-ROC score of 80.2% in the timeframe of 1999-2014 and 83.4% in 2003-2014 timeframe. XGBoost models perform the best in laboratory results in each of the cases, closely followed by the WEM model.

Model performance metrics for Case I shows tree based ensemble models - Random Forest and XGBoost along with the WEM model constantly outperform linear models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. This is further highlighted in the ROC curves in Fig. 2. In Case II, the distinction is less obvious with similar performance recorded from all models as shown in Fig. 3. In such a case, computationally less demanding models such as Logistic Regression can be used to achieve similar classification performance when compared to other complex models such as SVM or ensemble classifiers.

Analysis of feature variables in non-laboratory based models (within the diabetes data) shows features such as waist size, age, weight (self-reported and actual), leg-length, blood-pressure, BMI, household income, etc. contribute substantially towards the prediction of the model. This is similar to the observations and variables used in prior research [12, 13]. However, in our study we observe several dietary variables such as sodium, carbohydrate, fiber, and calcium intake contribute heavily towards diabetes detection in our models. Caffeine and alcohol consumption, along with relatives with diabetes, ethnicity, reported health condition, and high cholesterol also play key roles. Within the laboratory based data, the feature importance measures suggest blood osmolality, blood urea nitrogen content, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol are key factors in detection of diabetes. Each of the variables have been shown in prior research [30–33] to be key contributors or identifiers in diabetic patients. Age, waist circumference, leg length, weight, and sodium intake operate as common important variables for prediction between laboratory and survey data.

Prior research in the domain of predicting diabetes have reported results with high degree of accuracy. Using a neural network based approach to predict diabetes in the Pima Indian data set, Ayon et al. [34] observed an overall F1-score of 0.99. The analysis was based on data collected only from females of Pima Indian decent, and contained plasma glucose and serum insulin (which are key indicators of diabetes) as features for prediction. In comparison, our approach is a more generalized model where the demography of the patients is not restricted and does not contain plasma glucose and serum insulin levels (even in our laboratory based models). In [35] authors compare J48, AdaboostM1, SMO, Bayes Net, and Naïve Bayes, to identify diabetes based on non-invasive features. The study reports an F1 score of 0.95, and identify age as the most relevant feature in predicting diabetes, along with history of diabetes, work stress, BMI, salty food preferences, physical activity, hypertension, gender, and history of cardiovascular disease or stroke. While age, BMI, salt intake, and gender, were also identified in our study as pertinent variables, NHANES dataset does not contain (or has a high percentages of missing values) features of stress, history of cardiovascular disease, and physical activity. As a result the overall accuracy of the two studies cannot be compared directly. Heydari et al. [36] also compared SVM, artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, nearest neighbors, and Bayesian networks, with ANN reporting the highest accuracy of 98%. However, study pre-screened for type 2 diabetes and was able to collect features of family history of diabetes, and prior occurrences of diabetes, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, intake of drugs for high blood pressure, pregnancy and aborted pregnancy. Within our approach we consider both pre-diabetic and diabetic patients. Therefore, the results of this paper should be more accurate when applied to a diverse population which has not been screened for any pre-existing conditions.
Cardiovascular (CVD) PredictionModel performance towards the detection of at-risk patients of cardiovascular disease was pretty consistent across all models (AU-ROC difference of 1%, Fig. 6). While the WEM performed the best (AU-ROC 83.9%), other simplistic models such as logistic regression can provide similar results. This is partly due to the lack of large number of observations in the data, with total number of samples at 8,459, and also as a result of a high degree of imbalanced data with negative (0 label) versus positive (1 label) samples at 7,012 and 1,447 respectively. The applicability of ensemble based models (WEM, RFC, and XGBoost) can be further explored in the situations where large amounts of training observations are available, but in cases with limited observations computationally simple models like Logistic Regression can be used.Models developed based on laboratory based variables do not show any significant performance gain with an increase of only 0.7%. This suggests a predictive model based on survey data only can provide an accurate automated approach towards detection of cardiovascular patients. Analyzing the features present in non-laboratory data, the most important features include age, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, self-reported greatest weight, chest pain, alcohol consumption, and family history of heart attacks among others. Incidents of chest pain, alcohol consumption, and family history of cardiac issues have been identified in prior research  as high risk factors for heart disease. As shown in study conducted by Lloyd-Jones et al. age of the patients is a key risk variable in patients that is also identified by our models. A large number of feature importance variables are common across diabetes and cardiovascular patients, such as physical characteristics, dietary intake, and demographic characteristics. Similar factors (other than dietary variables) were identified by the study conducted by Stamler et al. , where they identified diabetes, age stratum, and ethnic background to be key contributors for cardiovascular disease. The laboratory based data analysis suggests features such as age, LDL and HDL cholesterol, chest pain, diastolic and systolic blood-pressure, self-reported greatest weight, calorie intake, and family history of cardiovascular problems as important variables. LDL and HDL cholesterol have been shown as high risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in prior research [42, 43]. Segmented neutrophils, monocyte, lymphocyte and eosinophilis counts recorded in the laboratory variables also have importance in this classification model. Similar to non-laboratory results, dietary variables such as calorie, carbohydrate, and calcium intake reappear in the list of important features."

Ensemble Learning Models Based on Noninvasive Features for Type 2 Diabetes Screening: Model Development and Validation. JMIR medical informatics, 8(6), e15431. https://doi.org/10.2196/15431",2020,"Ensemble Learning Models Based on Noninvasive Features for Type 2 Diabetes Screening: Model Development and Validation. Early diabetes screening can effectively reduce the burden of disease. However, natural population–based screening projects require a large number of resources. With the emergence and development of machine learning, researchers have started to pursue more flexible and efficient methods to screen or predict type 2 diabetes.
Objective. The aim of this study was to build prediction models based on the ensemble learning method for diabetes screening to further improve the health status of the population in a noninvasive and inexpensive manner.
Methods. The dataset for building and evaluating the diabetes prediction model was extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011-2016. After data cleaning and feature selection, the dataset was split into a training set (80%, 2011-2014), test set (20%, 2011-2014) and validation set (2015-2016). Three simple machine learning methods (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest) and easy ensemble methods were used to build diabetes prediction models. The performance of the models was evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. The Delong test (2-sided) was used to test the performance differences between the models. Results. We selected 8057 observations and 12 attributes from the database. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the three simple methods yielded highly predictive performance models with areas under the curve (AUCs) over 0.800, wherein the ensemble methods significantly outperformed the simple methods. When we evaluated the models in the test set and validation set, the same trends were observed. The ensemble model of linear discriminant analysis yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.849, an accuracy of 0.730, a sensitivity of 0.819, and a specificity of 0.709 in the validation set. Conclusions. This study indicates that efficient screening using machine learning methods with noninvasive tests can be applied to a large population and achieve the objective of secondary prevention. Comparison With Prior Work
The results of one analysis predicted that the world ranking of the number of years of life lost due to diabetes will increase from 15th to 7th by 2040. The fact that type 2 diabetes damages health conditions deserves special attention. In this article, we generated type 2 diabetes screening models and applied them to a large population. Although some researchers have studied machine learning models for screening and predicting type 2 diabetes, most of their studies focused on improving performance by selecting many features, such as blood test results, instead of considering the practical significance of cost and flexibility. In contrast, we used a noninvasive test covering demographic factors, body measurements, and questionnaire variables to build our models; this addresses the shortcomings of using invasive tests. Jai Won Chung et al also adopted noninvasive features to predict prediabetes, including age, gender, family history of diabetes, hypertension, alcohol intake, BMI, smoking status, waist circumference, and physical activity; they obtained a best AUC of 0.76 in the external test data. However, the attributes they chose were relatively traditional compared with those chosen in this study; in addition, the similarities between prediabetes and healthy cases can result in lower AUC values. The validation of our models indicates that body measurements and questionnaire questions can be used to predict whether a person has type 2 diabetes. In the case of further effects resulting from high blood sugar conditions, the models can be used to screen the identified people.
Principal Results
In the feature selection process in this study, traditional analyses such as the t test, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression were used. We extracted unusual attributes related to type 2 diabetes, such as sagittal abdominal diameter, relative leg length, and heart rate, which were proven to be significant in similar studies, in addition to some common risk factors, such as age, sex, alcohol use, and family history. Among these features, relative leg length was an interesting clue to type 2 diabetes that has not previously been used in type 2 diabetes prediction; this feature was selected by t test and forward conditional logistic regression. Epidemiological studies from various settings indicate that humans with shorter legs relative to their stature have higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Relative leg length can be easily determined and has a strong correlation with type 2 diabetes; therefore, it may be a useful new attribute in model building or epidemiology research. With increasing adoption of this feature, our model will be more accurate and dependable.
Reliable type 2 diabetes screening models based on noninvasive tests and machine learning algorithms were established and validated in this study. All the easy ensemble methods yielded higher predictive performance (AUC?0.85 and AUC?0.83, respectively) in the test set and validation set than the simple methods, indicating the efficiency of the ensemble methods. Screening models based on population are always an unbalanced problem, with more negative samples and fewer positive samples in the whole dataset. In other words, the learning ability of the models is not satisfied by the positive samples. We randomly matched a negative sample for every positive sample and generated 100 base models. This type of repeated learning from the positive samples may improve the results of the models. In addition to AUC, the application of the ensemble can increase the steadiness of the performance; this was exhibited by other measurements, such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and PPV. Compared with different machine learning methods, the ensemble method improvement is limited; this suggests that the dataset and features are more essential. In recent research, the results show that individuals with screen-detected type 2 diabetes were diagnosed earlier and had better outcomes than those who were clinically detected with regard to all-cause mortality, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, and retinopathy . In addition to earlier ordinal treatment, Ej et al introduced a method to recover the function of islets by diet control. Regardless of treatment, quality of life improvement and decreased disease burden are important.
Limitations
There are several limitations of our research project. The World Health Organization definition of diabetes is inferior to proper diagnosis by an experienced physician; also, we cannot clearly separate type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes, which would cause bias because of their different epidemiological attributes. After removing the baseline missing values and executing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, there were 10,710 samples in the entire database. Additionally, 2653 missing and biased values were removed. The proportion of patients with diabetes to patients without diabetes is approximately 1:5; therefore, the increased amount of abandoned diabetes data may reduce the predictive ability of the model. Reproducibility remains doubtful given the variable demographics of the different datasets. Only a study using noninvasive features to screen for diabetes can minimize the impact of demographic changes such as those considered in large population health studies and nutrition surveys. The best PPV was only 0.435 in the validation set; this indicates that only approximately 40% of true positive samples from the people detected positively by these models were patients with type 2 diabetes. A higher false-positive value increases the financial expenses of the health care system in the beginning; however, this type of screening program can improve the overall health of the population, and earlier diagnosis can decrease the disease burden, ultimately decreasing health care expenses related to diabetes. On one hand, although the easy ensemble method applied here addresses the unbalanced problem in one sense, more positive observations may yield better performance; on the other hand, the building of type 2 diabetes screening models is always an imbalanced problem when screening patients with type 2 diabetes from a large population. Therefore, we cannot solve the unbalanced problem completely. After considering all the other possible biases influencing the performance of the models, the key point is to further explore and optimize the unbalanced problem."

Aims The heterogeneity in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) risk factors among different populations impose challenges in developing a generic prediction model. This study evaluates the predictive ability of existing UK NICE guidelines for assessing GDM risk in Singaporean women, and used machine learning to develop a non-invasive predictive model. Methods. Data from 909 pregnancies in Singapore’s most deeply phenotyped mother-offspring cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO), was used for predictive modeling. We used a CatBoost gradient boosting algorithm, and the Shapley feature attribution framework for model building and interpretation of GDM risk attributes. Results. UK NICE guidelines showed poor predictability in Singaporean women [AUC:0.60 (95% CI 0.51, 0.70)]. The non-invasive predictive model comprising of 4 non-invasive factors: mean arterial blood pressure in first trimester, age, ethnicity and previous history of GDM, greatly outperformed [AUC:0.82 (95% CI 0.71, 0.93)] the UK NICE guidelines. Conclusion. The UK NICE guidelines may be insufficient to assess GDM risk in Asian women. Our non-invasive predictive model outperforms the current state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict GDM, is easily accessible and can be an effective approach to minimize the economic burden of universal testing & GDM associated healthcare in Asian populations. Our findings using the UK NICE model established the need for an improved GDM predictor in an Asian population, such as in Singapore. We observed that the risk factors in UK NICE guidelines had poor GDM predictive ability for the Singapore population (AUC:0.60). The lowering of the obesity BMI thresholds applicable to Asian women did not significantly improve the UK NICE model. We subsequently developed a two-tier GDM prediction panel that significantly outperformed the UK NICE guidelines. The first-tier GDM prediction panel is non-invasive and requires no fasting (AUC:0.82). The 4 features used in the non-invasive model can be easily measured and assessed during first trimester (mean arterial blood pressure at booking appointment, maternal age, previous history of GDM and ethnicity). Elevated mean arterial blood pressure at booking can be an early pregnancy sign of vulnerability to the metabolic syndrome of which insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism are prominent components. The case-control study by Savvidou et al provides further support to our finding, where GDM women had higher systolic blood pressure in early pregnancy. Hedderson et al reported similar findings, where high blood pressure in pregravid and early pregnancy states were associated with an increased risk of GDM . As blood pressure is a vital sign measured routinely at antenatal visits, mean arterial blood pressure is an easy and inexpensive clinical characteristic which can be used for GDM screening. Despite the evidence that GDM risk increases with age, higher maternal age is not included as one of the risk factors in UK NICE screening guidelines. This is particularly important keeping in mind that insulin resistance increases with age. With increasing age at pregnancy becoming more common in developed and developing countries, higher maternal age is an important attribute to be considered in GDM assessment. Previous history of GDM serves as an early approach to GDM surveillance. The importance of GDM history is supported by substantial epidemiologic evidence. In a recent meta-analysis by Lee et al, women with a previous history of GDM had an 8.42-fold increased risk of developing GDM when compared with women without a previous history of GDM. Studies on racial-ethnic differences in GDM risk have shown that Asians are a heterogeneous group by genetic background, culture, diet and other lifestyle factors. The UK NICE guidelines classify Indian ethnic women to be at high risk for GDM in Singapore’s population. In our study, we have shown that Chinese women are also at similar risk for GDM. With these findings, ethnicity-tailored preventive local programmes can be developed to improve the health literacies of GDM in high risk Chinese/Indian communities. In our non-invasive GDM prediction panel, the addition of mean arterial blood pressure, maternal age, previous history of GDM and ethnicity resulted in a significant performance improvement (?AUC=+0.26) when compared with the risk stratification model on previous GDM history. The 4 features in our non-invasive ‘NI4’ model have demonstrated stronger GDM predictive ability than the UK NICE model, suggesting that further improvements can be made in current risk assessment guidelines for GDM. The machine learning algorithm (LightGBM gradient boosting classifier) trained by Artzi et al achieved an impressive AUC of 0.80 with 9 questionnaire features for GDM detection. However, questionnaire features may introduce recall bias in predictive modelling (e.g. highest value of HbA1c% measured from previous pregnancy, results of OGTT from previous pregnancy). In another study by Wu et al, the machine learning algorithm (logistic regression classifier) achieved an AUC of 0.77 with 7 clinical features for early GDM prediction. The invasive model developed by Wu et al requires the measurement of fasting glucose, HbA1c and triglycerides. Our first-tier, non-invasive GDM prediction model has an improved performance (CatBoost model AUC:0.82) with 4 non-invasive features collected at first trimester, outperforming the current state-of-the-art machine learning models. The first-tier, non-invasive GDM prediction model can thus be an effective approach to screen and intervene early in women at risk, and also minimize the economic burden of universal testing and GDM associated healthcare in Asian populations. The second-tier panel is invasive and requires more advanced laboratory testing, which may not be routinely available in all standard clinical laboratories. Adiponectin contributed to a better performance improvement than IGF1. With adiponectin included, the predictive performance of the non-invasive panel can only be marginally enhanced [CatBoost ‘NI4_ADI’ model AUC:0.84 (95% CI 0.75, 0.93)]. Lower adiponectin concentrations are associated with visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and plays a critical role in metabolism. Visceral fat accumulation is one possible pathophysiological mechanism in GDM development. Although pre-pregnancy obesity is the second most important feature in UK NICE model, pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI>=30 kg/m2) was of low global importance in CatBoost feature selection model. As further evidenced by the stronger predictive ability of adiponectin, visceral fat accumulation (intra-abdominal fat) may be a better marker of adiposity in Asians. Increased dairy consumption in mid-gestation added minimal predictive value to second-tier panel [CatBoost ‘NI4_ADI_DI’ model AUC:0.85 (95% CI 0.79, 0.92)]. Dairy consumption in GUSTO cohort study was derived from milk, yoghurt, cheese, milk-based malt drinks and cultured yoghurt drinks. Our dietary finding can be explained by general food consumption patterns during pregnancy, where dairy and dairy product consumption is greatest during mid-pregnancy. In the study by Tucker et al, high dairy intake was a strong predictor of insulin resistance in women without diabetes. As mid-pregnancy is a critical window period for GDM development, dairy intake during pregnancy might be a modifiable GDM risk factor. With the two-tier GDM prediction panel, we have shown that model prediction can be slightly enhanced by incorporating features gathered during the course of gestation. We also have a well-defined validation framework in the study as the two-tier GDM prediction panel was compared against UK NICE guidelines. An added strength of the study is the utilization of SHAP framework to interpret machine learning model outputs and design a GDM prediction panel. This study has several limitations. Firstly, unlike large sample sizes in EHR databases, our prediction models were trained on a limited cohort of 909 pregnancies. However, EHR databases have inherent biases and are influenced by the individual’s interaction with local healthcare systems. With the prospective cohort study design, GUSTO data captures the dynamic nature of complex clinical pathways and is less prone to differential measurement errors. Secondly, the WHO 1999 GDM diagnostic criteria was in effect during two-point OGTT assessment in GUSTO study (fasting, 2-hour glucose measures). International Association of Diabetes Study Groups (IADPSG) 2018 has a less stringent criterion than WHO 1999, requiring just one abnormal glucose measure during a 2-hour 75g OGTT (fasting, 1-hour, 2-hour glucose measures). Tan et al reported that about one-third of GDM cases in KKH were diagnosed based on 1-hour glucose value. The lack of 1-hour glucose measure for full three-point IADPSG 2018 criteria in GUSTO study may underestimate GDM prevalence and affect model training (AUC metric of 0.71 for modified two-point IADPSG 2018 criteria is still indicative of predictive power). As supervised machine learning models are limited by the quality of ground truth to learn underlying patterns in data, the WHO 1999 criteria was a better ground truth labeler for training GDM algorithms using GUSTO cohort data. Thirdly, there may be biases in the predictive value of dairy-intake in GDM risk assessment, as this measure was derived from 24-hour dietary recall. Single day intake of dietary measure is subject to recall bias and day-to-day variation. A more accurate assessment of long term dietary patterns is required in the future to build strength in the predictive value of this measure. There is also a limitation of sample size on population genomic analyses (with < 1000 samples in GUSTO study). However, key variants and iOmics analyses in GUSTO cohort have identified IGF locus and blood measures of IGF to be associated with GDM. We hence used direct measures of plasma IGF in the current analysis. Lastly, the GUSTO cohort does not contain information of preconception parameters. With preconception data, we can possibly predict the risk of GDM during pregnancy initiation and intervene with early-stage nutritional & lifestyle changes. The longitudinal research in Singapore’s PREconception study of Long-Term Maternal and Child Outcomes (S-PRESTO) birth cohort study, may become the basis for preconception-based GDM prediction panels to be built in the future. Our first-tier, non-invasive predictive model would enable earlier interventions for GDM prevention and institution of earlier screening. Our machine learning tool can also be offered to pregnant women who are unwilling to have glucose challenge test taken. The trained GDM classifier can be deployed using a web application, where clinicians can enter patient information and obtain GDM risk prediction. The AI prediction model needs to be validated further using data from external cohorts or electronic health records in Singapore/Asia before deploying in local healthcare systems. A robust clinical evaluation via a randomized controlled trial is required to investigate the associations of the AI prediction tool with maternal and fetal outcomes."

The number of people suffering from diabetes in Taiwan has continued to rise in recent years. According to the statistics of the International Diabetes Federation, about 537 million people worldwide (10.5% of the global population) suffer from diabetes, and it is estimated that 643 million people will develop the condition (11.3% of the total population) by 2030. If this trend continues, the number will jump to 783 million (12.2%) by 2045. At present, the number of people with diabetes in Taiwan has reached 2.18 million, with an average of one in ten people suffering from the disease. In addition, according to the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan, the prevalence rate of diabetes among adults in Taiwan has reached 5% and is increasing each year. Diabetes can cause acute and chronic complications that can be fatal. Meanwhile, chronic complications can result in a variety of disabilities or organ decline. If holistic treatments and preventions are not provided to diabetic patients, it will lead to the consumption of more medical resources and a rapid decline in the quality of life of society as a whole. In this study, based on the outpatient examination data of a Taipei Municipal medical center, 15,000 women aged between 20 and 80 were selected as the subjects. These women were patients who had gone to the medical center during 2018–2020 and 2021–2022 with or without the diagnosis of diabetes. This study investigated eight different characteristics of the subjects, including the number of pregnancies, plasma glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, sebum thickness, insulin level, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age. After sorting out the complete data of the patients, this study used Microsoft Machine Learning Studio to train the models of various kinds of neural networks, and the prediction results were used to compare the predictive ability of the various parameters for diabetes. Finally, this study found that after comparing the models using two-class logistic regression as well as the two-class neural network, two-class decision jungle, or two-class boosted decision tree for prediction, the best model was the two-class boosted decision tree, as its area under the curve could reach a score of 0.991, which was better than other models. Diabetes is one of the most serious chronic diseases today, and early diagnosis can greatly improve patients’ chances of managing it. The latest developments in machine intelligence can be used to improve the understanding of the factors that lead to the onset of diabetes. This study used eight different characteristics (number of pregnancies, plasma glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, sebum thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age) for data preprocessing. After training, testing, cross-validation, and comparison, this study obtained the data for the model performance analysis. The results showed that all models achieved good results; however, the best models were the two-class decision jungle and two-class boosted decision tree. The area under the curve (AUC) was selected as the performance indicator and AUC scores of 0.976 and 0.991 were achieved, which was better than expected based on the literature Hasan et al .
These results provided an improvement to the existing prediction methods for diabetes. It is worthwhile to explore these models using unsupervised machine learning and deep learning techniques in future research."

",2022,"Data-Driven Machine-Learning Methods for Diabetes Risk Prediction. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition characterized by a disturbance in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The most characteristic disorder in all forms of diabetes is hyperglycemia, i.e., elevated blood sugar levels. The modern way of life has significantly increased the incidence of diabetes. Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is a necessity. Machine Learning (ML) has gained great popularity among healthcare providers and physicians due to its high potential in developing efficient tools for risk prediction, prognosis, treatment and the management of various conditions. In this study, a supervised learning methodology is described that aims to create risk prediction tools with high efficiency for type 2 diabetes occurrence. A features analysis is conducted to evaluate their importance and explore their association with diabetes. These features are the most common symptoms that often develop slowly with diabetes, and they are utilized to train and test several ML models. Various ML models are evaluated in terms of the Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Accuracy and AUC metrics and compared under 10-fold cross-validation and data splitting. Both validation methods highlighted Random Forest and K-NN as the best performing models in comparison to the other models. The habits and lifestyle of the modern world are the results of the growing incidence of diabetes. Medical professionals now have the opportunity, with the contribution of machine-learning techniques, to assess the relative risk and provide appropriate guidelines and interventions for the management and treatment or prevention of diabetes. In this research article, we applied several machine-learning models in order to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on specific risk factors. Data exploration through risk factor analysis could help to identify associations between the features and diabetes. Performance analysis showed that data pre-processing is a major step in the design of efficient and accurate models for diabetes occurrence. Specifically, after applying SMOTE with 10-fold cross-validation, the Random Forest and KNN outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 98.59%. Similarly, applying SMOTE with a percentage split (80:20), the Random Forest and KNN outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 99.22%. In both cases, applying SMOTE, our proposed models were superior to the related published research works based on thedataset with the same features we relied on in terms of accuracy. In future work, we aim to extend the machine-learning framework through the use of deep-learning methods by applying a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) algorithm and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the same dataset and comparing the results in terms of accuracy with relevant published works."

In addition, to improve the convenience and flexibility of the model, a diabetes risk score card was established based on logistic regression to assess the risk of the population. Results. An XGBoost-based risk prediction model outperformed the other five risk assessment algorithms. The AUC of the model was 0.9122. Based on the feature importance ranking map, we found that hypertension, fasting blood glucose, age, coronary heart disease, ethnicity, parental diabetes mellitus, triglycerides, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and body mass index were the most important features of the risk prediction model for type-2 diabetes. Conclusions. This study established a diabetes risk assessment model based on multiple ethnicities, a large sample and many indices, and classified the diabetes risk of the population, thus providing a new forecast tool for the screening of patients and providing information on diabetes prevention for healthy populations. The increasing burden of diabetes has become a global challenge. Through mass screening, early identification and intervention of patients with diabetes can be achieved to delay or prevent the development of the disease. The most efficacious method for widespread screening of diabetes has yet to be identified. In this study, the T2DM risk prediction models were developed and validated on data from more than 4 million people. The data were obtained from the cross-sectional data of NPE, including more than 9 million people in 14 prefectures of Xinjiang, China, which can be considered representative of the overall population of Xinjiang. Following the evaluation of the model's performance, it was determined that the XGBoost model was the optimal model for predicting the risk of T2DM, with an AUC was is 0.9122. In this study, we used questionnaires to obtain indicators of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, genetic history and smoking and diet in the population, which not only captured the medical history of each patient, but also included demographic factors and laboratory test indicators. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that sex, age, ethnicity, EH, SS, HTN, CAD, PDM, WC, BMI, WBC, PLT, FBG, ECG, TC, TG, LDLC, and HDLC were important factors for diabetes. HTN, FGB, age, PDM, CAD, ethnicity, TG, WC, BMI, and TC were the most important predictors of diabetes. Except that the FGB was viewed as a recognized risk factor and predictor of T2DM, hypertension and CAD were the most important features of T2DM risk models, which presented with high predictive ability. Some studies have confirmed that hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes are mutually promote and influence each other. Many pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Among these mechanisms, several have been identified as potential contributors. Including insulin resistance in the nitric-oxide pathway, the stimulatory effect of hyperinsulinemia on sympathetic drive, smooth muscle growth, and sodium-fluid retention, as well as the excitatory effect of hyperglycemia on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, provide plausible explanations for the association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, the functional changes occurring in the context of T2DM and hypertension significantly alter the hemodynamic stress on the heart and other organs. Some studies have also demonstrated the important role of ECG in the prediction of diabetes, and our study confirmed the association between abnormal ECG results and T2DM. Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted interventions to prevent and manage cardiovascular complications in individuals with diabetes.
Our study showed that age was also an important feature of diabetes prediction models. The FDRSMA is a classic and widely used diabetes risk scoring model. The objective of FDRSM is to utilize six risk factors (including BMI, FBG, PDM, HDLC, blood pressure and TG) to evaluate the risk of T2DM among middle-aged individuals. T2DM is generally observed in adults and appears to be more prevalent among the elderly individuals. As people age, the glucose sensitivity of pancreatic cells decline and insulin secretion is impaired, leading to hyperglycemia and T2DM. Several studies reported differences in the incidence of diabetes between ethnic groups and confirmed that ethnicity could be a predictors of diabetes. In our study, we used Uyghur as a reference, with Han and Hui ethnic groups exhibiting a heightened susceptibility to diabetes. The kazakh, Mongolian and Tajik ethnic groups had a lower risk. Genetic and environmental differences (i.e., economic level, diet, lifestyle, climate) were taken into account. Family history of diabetes was also identified as an important risk factor for T2DM in our model, which is consistent with previous studies. There is a significant genetic predisposition to T2DM, with a 2 to 30 fold increased risk for T2DM in those with a family history compared with those without a family history.
Many studies have demonstrated a connection between obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, our study discovered that augmented BMI and WC were correlated with a higher probability of having diabetes. The development of obesity gain can result in insulin resistance and diminished ?-cell functionality in humans. According to the World Health Organization, the global increase in the prevalence of diabetes is believed to be related to chronic stress, being overweight, lacking of physical activity , excessive consumption of alcoholand an unhealthy diet. Our model also demonstrated that EH and SS were predictors of T2DM. In addition, we also found that people who smoked and those who had quit smoking had a higher risk of T2DM than those who did not smoke, and those who ate a vegetarian or meat-based diet had a higher probability of T2DM than those who ate a balanced meat-vegetarian diet. We incorporated laboratory variables, including TC, TG and HDLC into the diabetes prediction model. Our findings indicated that TG was an independent risk factor for T2DM, while TC was not an independent risk factor for T2DM in our study. Consistent with other studies. The feature importance ranking showed that TC, TG, LDLC and HDLC were all important features of the T2DM risk prediction model. Multiple studies have revealed that dyslipidemia and T2DM often coexist in individuals and share common pathological mechanisms, such as insulin resistance, metabolic disturbances, inflammation, and alterations in the gut microbiota. Currently, ML algorithms are increasingly used to predict diabetes and related disease. In this study, a diabetes screening model based on CART, LightGBM, RF, XGBoost TabNet and MLP models was constructed. The AUC (0.9122), PPV (0.2800), NPV (0.9829) and accuracy (0.8314) of the XGBoost prediction model showed good performance in the validation group. It appears that our model outperforms the majority of existing models, which may be because the model is built on the basis of multiple features and big data. Other studies also found that XGBoost was effective in predicting the risk of diabetes.
The development of the diabetes risk assessment score card assists clinicians and individuals alike in conducting self-examinations, with the aim of increasing the rate of diabetes cascade screening and enhancing individual lifestyle management. Hence, utilizing large-scale physical examination information to achieve prompt risk notification and identification of diabetes is the most practicable course of action. This study has several advantages. First, based on the NPE project, it not only has a wide coverage and a large amount of data, but also includes a number of major ethnic groups in China, which can enable better assessment of the characteristics of the population in Xinjiang, China; in addition the risk prediction model has a good generalization ability in Xinjiang, China. Second, the risk factors affecting diabetes were fully considered in this study. Laboratory examination, questionnaire survey and routine examination data were fully taken into account to obtain indicators such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, genetic history and exercise and diet in the population, and the influencing factors of diabetes were comprehensively analyzed. Third, the results of our model all showed satisfactory predictive effects (XGBoost: AUC?=?0.9122). This study also has several limitations. First, it is not possible to establish causality using cross-sectional data derived from national health examinations, therefore, these results should be subject to further investigated in subsequent research. Second, the health examination data used in our study were highly heterogeneous and had a high rate of missing data, which affected the power of the model."

Scientific reports, 10(1), 4406. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61123-x",2020,"Machine learning for characterizing risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a rural Chinese population: the Henan Rural Cohort Study. With the development of data mining, machine learning offers opportunities to improve discrimination by analyzing complex interactions among massive variables. To test the ability of machine learning algorithms for predicting risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rural Chinese population, we focus on a total of 36,652 eligible participants from the Henan Rural Cohort Study. Risk assessment models for T2DM were developed using six machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). The model performance was measured in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under precision recall curve. The importance of variables was identified based on each classifier and the shapley additive explanations approach. Using all available variables, all models for predicting risk of T2DM demonstrated strong predictive performance, with AUCs ranging between 0.811 and 0.872 using laboratory data and from 0.767 to 0.817 without laboratory data. Among them, the GBM model performed best (AUC: 0.872 with laboratory data and 0.817 without laboratory data). Performance of models plateaued when introduced 30 variables to each model except CART model. Among the top-10 variables across all methods were sweet flavor, urine glucose, age, heart rate, creatinine, waist circumference, uric acid, pulse pressure, insulin, and hypertension. New important risk factors (urinary indicators, sweet flavor) were not found in previous risk prediction methods, but determined by machine learning in our study. Through the results, machine learning methods showed competence in predicting risk of T2DM, leading to greater insights on disease risk factors with no priori assumption of causality. Using machine learning methods, this study developed several risk assessment models for characterizing the risk of developing T2DM. High predictive performance was achieved by all models, with AUCs ranging from 0.811to 0.872. Compared to other models, the GBM model performed the best, with an AUC value of 0.872 (95% 0.858–0.886) and the models’ performance significantly better than the traditional risk score. In addition to common factors for diabetes, new important factors (urinary parameters) were not found in previous risk assessment methods, but determined by machine learning in our study. Our study demonstrated that machine learning technologies are uniquely positioned to identify significant risk factors in large-scale epidemiological studies.To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the importance of variables and characterize the risk of developing T2DM with use of different machine learning methods in a Chinese rural population. Our results were consistent with the previous findings. The New Chinese Diabetes Risk Score showed that sex, age, family history of diabetes, waist circumference, BMI, SBP were important risk factors. Our results also revealed their prominent presence on the top-10 key factors for T2DM. Our data also indicated that obesity was a major risk factor for the development of T2DM. The previous studies have demonstrated the significant role of boosting method in other medical fields, such as urinary tract infections, hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis, prediction of hip fracture. Our results confirmed the outstanding performance of the boosting method in the risk assessment of T2DM. Identifying the key factors is of great clinical significance in the risk assessment of T2DM. The severity of T2DM is often estimated through a lot of factors in different aspects, including socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measures and laboratory test data. Given that the diversity and massive of factors in the development phase of T2DM, it is difficult to choose a specific number of variables for risk assessment. Compared to models with no laboratory data, the inclusion of laboratory data resulted in significant increase in the identification capabilities of models. This phenomenon shows that adding effective laboratory data can help identify the risk of T2DM patients. Our study also showed that the importance of different factors depended on the modeling technique. For LR, SVM and ANN models, the genetic factors and urinary indicators, such as diabetes history of mother/father, urine glucose, occupied center stage in the risk assessment of T2DM. Moreover, our results showed 30–35 variables were needed when the model performance reached a plateau, and the model performance would not be improved with too many variables. Over the past decade, the ability to collect data has become faster and cheaper, but we need to pay more attention to the model with too many features.Data analysis techniques or model fitting ability are important in disease risk assessment and prediction. With the use of traditional statistical approaches, many risk scores and prediction models have been developed based on logistic regression. If the relationship among the data is linearly separable, traditional methods will fit better. If not, such models may oversimplify complex relationships among factors with nonlinear interactions, leading to the potential loss of important relevant information. This suggests the important of choosing an appropriate model according to the characteristics of the data set. According to the data characteristics of the Henan Rural Cohort Study, our results showed the boosting model fit data best.The performance of diagnosis model based on machine learning will be better if the number of training samples is large. Compared to previous studies, the major strength of our study was the relatively large sample size including 36652 subjects from the rural population in China. Also, we compared the model performance from two aspects: the fixed number of variables and the dynamic number of variables, which confirmed models with several variables could perform no worse than the model with all variables. Furthermore, the superiority and feasibility of nonparametric algorithms were proved compared with the model based on logistic regression.However, several limitations should be worth mentioning. Firstly, the research findings were derived from a cross-sectional study without follow-up data; therefore, we may not be able to determine the causal and temporal associations. Secondly, we need to do future research with external validation and other machine learning methods to assess the model performance. In addition, it’s difficult to explain the inherent complexity of variable interactions and their impacts on outcomes due to the “black box” nature of machine learning methods.In conclusion, using a series of machine learning models, we developed a data mining approach to characterize risk ofT2DM and compared the model performance from the fixed number of variables and the dynamic number of variables. Our results showed the advantage ability of machine learning to identify risk factors and predict outcomes across a wide range of data and an increasing number of variables, which leading to greater insights on disease risk factors with no prior assumption of causality."

Machine learning models for prediction of invasion Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome in diabetes mellitus: a singled centered retrospective study. BMC infectious diseases, 23(1), 284. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-023-08235-7",2023,"Machine learning models for prediction of invasion Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome in diabetes mellitus: a singled centered retrospective study. This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm-based model for predicting invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome(IKPLAS) in diabetes mellitus and compare the performance of different models. Methods. The clinical signs and data on the admission of 213 diabetic patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscesses were collected as variables. The optimal feature variables were screened out, and then Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and XGBoost models were established. Finally, the model's prediction performance was evaluated by the ROC curve, sensitivity (recall), specificity, accuracy, precision, F1-score, Average Precision, calibration curve, and DCA curve.Results Four features of hemoglobin, platelet, D-dimer, and SOFA score were screened by the recursive elimination method, and seven prediction models were established based on these variables. The AUC (0.969), F1-Score(0.737), Sensitivity(0.875) and AP(0.890) of the SVM model were the highest among the seven models. The KNN model showed the highest specificity (1.000). Except that the XGB and DT models over-estimates the occurrence of IKPLAS risk, the other models' calibration curves are a good fit with the actual observed results. Decision Curve Analysis showed that when the risk threshold was between 0.4 and 0.8, the net rate of intervention of the SVM model was significantly higher than that of other models. In the feature importance ranking, the SOFA score impacted the model significantly. An effective prediction model of invasion Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome in diabetes mellitus could be established by a machine learning algorithm, which had potential application value. The high incidence of IKPLAS is mainly in the Asian population, which may be related to the fact that the Asian population is more likely to colonize the intestine with K1/K2 serotype Klebsiella pneumoniae. Diabetes is considered a significant risk factor for IKPLAS, and up to 63% of patients with a bacterial liver abscess in Taiwan have diabetes. This may be related to the impaired phagocytosis of K1/K2 Klebsiella pneumoniae in diabetic patients and the more excellent vascular permeability in diabetic patients, which is conducive to bacterial invasion. The above two serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae are also highly virulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, which show high viscosity in the String test. Although the highly virulent Klebsiella pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics, patients often have a poor prognosis if they are not recognized and treated early. This study screened four characteristic variables: hemoglobin, platelets, D-dimer, and SOFA score. We interpreted the importance of the model characteristic variables by using the SHAP package, in which the SOFA score ranked first among all four models. The SOFA score is a scoring system that measures the degree of impairment of significant organ function in patients with sepsis or suspected sepsis to determine prognosis. Several studies have confirmed its predictive value in the prognosis of infected patients. This study also suggests that the SOFA score is a significant predictor of diabetes complicated by IKPLAS. As can be seen from the SHAP plot, the higher the SOFA score, the greater the risk of progression to IKPLAS. Although the pathogenesis of IKPLAS is currently unclear, the study by Chen-Guang Zhang et al. shows that most diabetic patients with IKPLAS are prone to sepsis. Blood-borne transmission may be one of the more important ways. In the feature importance ranking, platelets' influence on SVM model ranked second.Jai Hoon Yoon et al. showed that thrombocytopenia is an independent risk factor for invasive syndrome in diabetic patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess . This is also consistent with the conclusions about platelets in the SVM model established in this study. The mechanism of platelet reduction in diabetes combined with IKPLAS may be that when the body is infected, platelets are stimulated and activated to participate in the body's inflammatory response by inducing the expression of membrane proteins and the production of mediators and play the role of anti-infection and pathogen removal. Activated platelets produce and release pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, chemokines, antimicrobial, and other mediators to regulate the body's innate immune or adaptive immune response. The interaction between platelets and pathogens or their products, endothelial cells, and immune cells promotes endothelial cell damage and leukocyte activation. As a result, the adhesion of platelets to it is enhanced, platelets are continuously activated in the circulation, and the body continuously produces anti-platelet antibodies and macrophage-colony stimulating factors, which accelerates the destruction and consumption of platelets. The SHAP plot shows that hemoglobin is the third most important characteristic variable after the SOFA score, and the lower its value, the higher the risk of progression to IKPLAS. It has been shown that hemoglobin can be an indicator to assess the severity of the disease in infected patients, probably due to a systemic inflammatory response leading to decreased erythropoiesis, increased destruction of erythrocytes due to hemolysis, and hemorrhage, which leads to a reduced ability of blood to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide and insufficient oxygen supply to the body, resulting in multi-organ damage. D-dimer is a specific molecular marker for secondary hyperfibrinolysis in vivo and is an effective indicator to reflect the coagulation state of the body. The coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are usually closely linked to the development of inflammation. Infection can lead to damage of vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, which stimulates the coagulation system, resulting in impairment of coagulation function and abnormal coagulation indexes in patients, further aggravated by elevated D-dimer along with infection. The above two promote each other, forming a vicious circle. The autoimmune function of diabetic patients is weakened, and the inflammatory response is enhanced after infection. Patients with diabetes complicated with IKPLAS can have noticeable D-dimer changes in the early stage. In the SVM model, D-dimer was positively associated with the risk of developing diabetes with IKPLAS, which is consistent with the above findings. In the field of IKPLAS, more studies are focused on the risk factors of IKPLAS.The study by Shixiao Li et al. showed that patients with IKPLAS were more likely to develop chronic renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and increased total bilirubin than patients with non-IKPLAS. Hairui Wang et al.. A logistic regression prediction model was used to predict the incidence of IKPLAS by incorporating clinical and CT features, with an AUC value of 0.842 in the validation set, and did not compare other prediction models. Unlike many studies, we first used seven machine learning models for prediction. Through parameter adjustment and verification, the SVM model with the best performance was selected, with an AUC value of 0.969 and an AP value of 0.890, indicating that it was a reliable IKPLAS prediction model. At the same time, the variables included in this model are clinical indicators, which are easy to collect and can be used by clinicians to conveniently judge the possibility of IKPLAS in patients with diabetes mellitus complicated with Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess. Machine learning algorithms can build complex models that perform satisfactorily enough when the amount of data is sufficient. However, in specific applications, the amount of data is often insufficient, so it is essential to analyze these machine learning algorithms and obtain good results with relatively small sample sizes. In this study, the Power analysis was satisfied by calculating a power value of?>?0.80, although we only used a small data set of 213 patients. The main reason for the excellent performance of the SVM model in this study is that it is a nonlinear learner that is more suitable for small samples, can ideally separate samples, and has better generalization. There are still some limitations in this study. First, this is a single-center regression study, and some potential biases cannot be avoided. Secondly, for machine learning, the sample size of this study is insufficient. In order to further improve the accuracy of the model, we will collect more clinical data and further optimize the parameters."

Systems-level barriers to diabetes care could be improved with population health planning tools that accurately discriminate between high- and low-risk groups to guide investments and targeted interventions. To develop and validate a population-level machine learning model for predicting type 2 diabetes 5 years before diabetes onset using administrative health data.  This decision analytical model study used linked administrative health data from the diverse, single-payer health system in Ontario, Canada, between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2016. A gradient boosting decision tree model was trained on data from 1?657?395 patients, validated on 243?442 patients, and tested on 236?506 patients. Costs associated with each patient were estimated using a validated costing algorithm. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2016.Exposures A random sample of 2?137?343 residents of Ontario without type 2 diabetes was obtained at study start time. More than 300 features from data sets capturing demographic information, laboratory measurements, drug benefits, health care system interactions, social determinants of health, and ambulatory care and hospitalization records were compiled over 2-year patient medical histories to generate quarterly predictions. Main Outcomes and Measures Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic, and calibration was assessed visually using calibration plots. Feature contribution was assessed with Shapley values. Costs were estimated in 2020 US dollars. This study trained a gradient boosting decision tree model on data from 1 657 395 patients (12 900 257 instances; 6 666 662 women [51.7%]). The developed model achieved a test area under the curve of 80.26 (range, 80.21-80.29), demonstrated good calibration, and was robust to sex, immigration status, area-level marginalization with regard to material deprivation and race/ethnicity, and low contact with the health care system. The top 5% of patients predicted as high risk by the model represented 26% of the total annual diabetes cost in Ontario. In this decision analytical model study, a machine learning model approach accurately predicted the incidence of diabetes in the population using routinely collected health administrative data. These results suggest that the model could be used to inform decision-making for population health planning and diabetes prevention. This decision analytical model study found that accurate prediction of type 2 diabetes onset at the population level 5 years in advance was possible solely from routinely collected administrative health data for the purposes of public health planning and health resource allocation. It was not our goal for this model to be applied in the context of individual patient care. Our model was trained and validated on more than 2 million patients, which, to our knowledge, is one of the largest cohorts for predicting diabetes incidence. Our model showed consistent calibration across sex, immigration status, racial/ethnic and material deprivation, and a low to moderate number of events in the health care history of the patient. The cohort was representative of the whole population of Ontario, which is itself among the most diverse in the world. The model was well calibrated, and its discrimination, although with a slightly different end goal, was competitive with results reported in the literature for other machine learning–based studies that used more granular clinical data from electronic medical records without any modifications to the original test set distribution. Assessing risk in populations is the basis of health system planning and a critical element of diabetes prevention. When managing risk in populations, there are critical questions regarding the most efficient usage of resources, and without a comprehensive estimate of risk in populations, strategies can be costly and ineffective. Furthermore, it is widely recognized that the prevention of diabetes is not only influenced by factors at the individual level but must be complemented by whole population approaches, such as food policies and environmental changes. The use of machine learning methods for predicting risk in populations offers an important opportunity to inform resource and policy-level decisions that can change diabetes risk trajectories as well as allow for more efficient targeting of resources within a health system. The growing burden of diabetes is a challenge faced by other jurisdictions across the globe. Continuous risk assessment using the multi-instance approach we proposed could reduce this cost through the targeting of preventive health measures, even more so given the fact that our model did not require additional data collection. Such an approach could be feasible in countries such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and the Scandinavian countries, which have large, administrative databases suitable for linkage. Furthermore, this approach could also be deployed in populations covered under a singular health insurance system, such as Medicare or private insurers. Our features not only captured each patient’s medical history but also included the social and demographic determinants of health, which are important predictors of a patient’s overall risk of developing diabetes and are often missing in clinical data sources. Moreover, the calibration of our machine learning model across demographic subgroups suggests that it may be possible to apply it to target-specific population segments with preventive measures Diabetes prevention strategies can be targeted toward those above a certain risk threshold. Our model results suggest that older patients from the most marginalized neighborhoods in terms of race/ethnicity and material deprivation were at the highest risk and may therefore benefit the most from preventive measures. Given the growing costs associated with the diabetes cohort, our work suggests a quantitative financial incentive toward the direction of preventive measures that consider those at greatest risk, including from a socioeconomic perspective. Because our machine learning model included social determinants of health that are known to contribute to diabetes risk, our population-wide approach to risk assessment may represent a tool for addressing health disparities. Our study approach had several strengths. Owing to the nature of administrative data, such an approach could be applied to other chronic diseases. In 2009, 24.3% of Ontarians were found to be affected by multiple comorbidities. Accurately forecasting other prominent chronic conditions, such as hypertension, could lead to potential considerable reductions in health care costs while also improving the health and well-being of the population. Similar work to create risk prediction models has been done in a primary prevention cohort from New Zealand to determine 5-year cardiovascular disease risk, and research from the UK reinforces that reducing cardiovascular event risk by even 1% would result in both large cost savings and improved population health. Moreover, we included a detailed calibration assessment, both overall and within key population subgroups, which suggests that our model did not only have strong discrimination but was well calibrated in a diverse population. Finally, the choice of using a gradient boosting machine model permitted the usage of Shapley values to enhance explainability. Our proposed approach also had some important limitations. First, there was the potential for misclassification of patients with type 1 diabetes given limitations with the algorithm used in label construction of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Of the roughly 2% to 3% of individuals aged 20 years or younger who tested positive for diabetes, we are uncertain how many were actually diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. However, we chose not to exclude younger patients in our cohort owing to the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes in youths and young adults. Second, the input administrative health data were highly heterogeneous: only 23.4% of patients had at least 1 laboratory value, and only the patients older than 65 years had a prescription history. We believe that more consistency and fewer missing values in the input data would improve the model’s discrimination. Third, administrative data often does not capture certain features known to be highly predictive of diabetes onset, such as body mass index; however, we achieved competitive performance when our machine learning model was compared to those trained on richer sources of data while allowing for applicability at the population level. Fourth, although we can interpret the model’s decisions and the way it splits variables to separate patients into risk score categories, the model strictly captured correlations in the data and not causal pathways. Finally, our model would need to be further validated through prospective studies before deployment."

Application of Machine Learning Models for Early Detection and Accurate Classification of Type 2 Diabetes. Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland), 13(14), 2383. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13142383",2023,"Application of Machine Learning Models for Early Detection and Accurate Classification of Type 2 Diabetes. Early detection of diabetes is essential to prevent serious complications in patients. The purpose of this work is to detect and classify type 2 diabetes in patients using machine learning (ML) models, and to select the most optimal model to predict the risk of diabetes. In this paper, five ML models, including K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Bernoulli Naïve Bayes (BNB), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM), are investigated to predict diabetic patients. A Kaggle-hosted Pima Indian dataset containing 768 patients with and without diabetes was used, including variables such as number of pregnancies the patient has had, blood glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, skinfold thickness, body insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), genetic background, diabetes in the family tree, age, and outcome (with/without diabetes). The results show that the K-NN and BNB models outperform the other models. The K-NN model obtained the best accuracy in detecting diabetes, with 79.6% accuracy, while the BNB model obtained 77.2% accuracy in detecting diabetes. Finally, it can be stated that the use of ML models for the early detection of diabetes is very promising. The detection and classification of diabetes is a problem for data science and medical science. There are many ML algorithms that are used to address this problem. In this paper, we used five of the most popular algorithms used to identify and classify binary problems such as diabetes including K-NN, DT, LR, BNB, and SVM. All five models are very useful for diabetes classification, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, K-NN is simple and easy to implement but can be sensitive to outlier data points. On the other hand, BNB is less sensitive to outlier data points and performs well on large and noisy datasets. The DT, LR, and SVM models behave in much the same way, and they are widely used algorithms for diabetes classification, each with its advantages and disadvantages. DTs are easy to understand and fit, LR is simple and fast, and SVMs are very accurate in classifying nonlinear data. The results achieved in this work, mainly with the K-NN and BNB models, are acceptable, as shown. The K-NN model achieved an accuracy of 79.6%; this result is similar to that obtained in where they used this algorithm and neural networks to classify diabetes, obtaining an accuracy of 88.6%. However, in, the K-NN model reached an accuracy of 86% when used to diagnose and classify diabetes using ML algorithms. The results depend directly on the dataset and its characteristics. In a similar way, these results were also found with the BNB model, which also achieved a very good result of 77.2% accuracy. However, this result is significantly different from that achieved in since in that work, it was used to classify peripheral arterial disease in patients with type 2 diabetes using ML models, and the model achieved a performance of 92% accuracy and a sensitivity of 91.80%. The difference in accuracy results is mainly due to the dataset with which it is processed and the characteristics it includes. The DT and SVM models did not obtain the expected results, only reaching 63% and 71.7% accuracy, and these results are below the threshold. However, the DT model used in achieved a performance of 90.8% accuracy. Meanwhile, the SVM model used in only achieved a performance of 57.4% accuracy. This does not mean that ML models are not efficient classifiers, rather, the results basically depend on the characteristics of the dataset. Finally, the LR model achieved a performance of 72.7% accuracy. This result is related to that obtained in the work , where they used this model to predict diabetes based on ML, achieving a performance of 75% accuracy. In the different works reviewed, it is evident that the LR model has not obtained significant results, probably due to the simplicity of the algorithm at the time of training and prediction. In addition, there are factors that affect the results. The strengths of this work for detecting and classifying type 2 diabetes basically lie in the following: (1) Accuracy: ML models are able to identify complex patterns in large datasets. (2) Scalability: ML models can also handle large volumes of data efficiently. (3) Flexibility: ML models can be used to predict diabetes in different populations. (4) Speed: ML models generate very fast predictions; hence, they can help to make decisions in real-time."

Journal of healthcare engineering, 2023, 6992441. https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/6992441",2023,"Clinical Decision Support System for Diabetic Patients by Predicting Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Algorithms. Diabetes is one of the most serious chronic diseases that result in high blood sugar levels. Early prediction can significantly diminish the potential jeopardy and severity of diabetes. In this study, different machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to predict whether an unknown sample had diabetes or not. However, the main significance of this research was to provide a clinical decision support system (CDSS) by predicting type 2 diabetes using different ML algorithms. For the research purpose, the publicly available Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset was used. Data preprocessing, K-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and various ML classifiers such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and histogram-based gradient boosting (HBGB) were used. Several scaling methods were also used to improve the accuracy of the result. For further research, a rule-based approach was used to escalate the effectiveness of the system. After that, the accuracy of DT and HBGB was above 90%. Based on this result, the CDSS was implemented where users can give the required input parameters through a web-based user interface to get decision support with some analytical results for the individual patient. The CDSS, which was implemented, will be beneficial for physicians and patients to make decisions about diabetes diagnosis and offer real-time analysis-based suggestions to improve medical quality. For future work, if daily data of a diabetic patient can be put together, then a better clinical support system can be implemented for daily decision support for patients worldwide. In this research, an expert system is presented to help physicians as well as patients to make decisions about diabetes diagnosis and to offer real-time analysis-based suggestions to improve medical quality. The time-consuming identification process leads to a patient's appointment at a diagnostic center and consultation with a doctor. For predicting diabetes, several ML classification techniques were applied with different scaling methods. A rule-based approach with the HBGB classifier provides the highest accuracy of 92.21%. Since the best result for our prediction system was obtained from HBGB, this algorithm can be used for the proposed CDSS. This proposed system will also be very beneficial for the nondiabetic patient as it will show a comparative analysis of different parameters that are directly responsible for diabetes disease. For the automation of diabetes analysis, the work can be expanded and enhanced. In future work, feature selection techniques can be implemented to check the effects on accuracy improvement with various subsets of features. It is also planned to collect data from many regions across the globe in the future to create a more accurate and broader predictive model for diabetes decisions. If daily data of diabetes patients can be put together, then a clinical support system can be implemented for daily decision support for patients worldwide."

Environment-wide association study (EWAS) for type 2 diabetes in the Marshfield Personalized Medicine Research Project Biobank. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, 200–211. ",2014,"Environment-wide association study (EWAS) for type 2 diabetes in the Marshfield Personalized Medicine Research Project Biobank. Environment-wide association studies (EWAS) provide a way to uncover the environmental mechanisms involved in complex traits in a high-throughput manner. Genome-wide association studies have led to the discovery of genetic variants associated with many common diseases but do not take into account the environmental component of complex phenotypes. This EWAS assesses the comprehensive association between environmental variables and the outcome of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Marshfield Personalized Medicine Research Project Biobank (Marshfield PMRP). We sought replication in two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The Marshfield PMRP currently uses four tools for measuring environmental exposures and outcome traits: 1) the PhenX Toolkit includes standardized exposure and phenotypic measures across several domains, 2) the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) is a food frequency questionnaire, 3) the Measurement of a Person's Habitual Physical Activity scores the level of an individual's physical activity, and 4) electronic health records (EHR) employs validated algorithms to establish T2D case-control status. Using PLATO software, 314 environmental variables were tested for association with T2D using logistic regression, adjusting for sex, age, and BMI in over 2,200 European Americans. When available, similar variables were tested with the same methods and adjustment in samples from NHANES III and NHANES 1999-2002. Twelve and 31 associations were identified in the Marshfield samples at p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively. Seven and 13 measures replicated in at least one of the NHANES at p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively, with the same direction of effect. The most significant environmental exposures associated with T2D status included decreased alcohol use as well as increased smoking exposure in childhood and adulthood. The results demonstrate the utility of the EWAS method and survey tools for identifying environmental components of complex diseases like type 2 diabetes. These high-throughput and comprehensive investigation methods can easily be applied to investigate the relation between environmental exposures and multiple phenotypes in future analyses. Using a systematic, high-throughput EWAS method, we identified and replicated novel as well as established associations between environmental exposures and T2D. The replicating results of the association between less alcohol use per month and T2D status is consistent with prior research that demonstrates that moderate alcohol use is associated with decreased risk of T2D. The association between T2D status and the specific symptoms of hallucination and liver disease has not been observed in the literature, to the best of the authors’ knowledge. However, prior research has indicated that binge drinking and high levels of alcohol use are associated with increased risk of T2D. It is possible that these results are spurious, or that there may be some mechanism at play by which these extreme alcohol-related measures are related to T2D. Comparison with other studies for this measure is necessary before conclusions can be drawn. The relationship between increased smoking exposure and having T2D is also well established. Activity level also has a well-documented link with T2D. Here we observed a number of results from both Marshfield and NHANES III that demonstrate this association. Work activity was not significantly associated with T2D in the PhenX or Baecke measures. However, lower amounts of leisure and sports activity was associated with T2D status in Marshfield. This relationship was validated with similar measures in NHANES III: dancing, gardening/yard work, sports, and running or jogging in the past month. A number of associations from the residence, depression, mania, and UV exposure classes in Marshfield did not replicate in either NHANES. This could indicate that these were false positive findings, or it could also be due to differences in measures that were used, deviation in survey question wording, or low sample sizes for a given question. Additionally, many of these results could not be evaluated for replication in either NHANES because they were not available. This demonstrates the need for standardized measures of environmental exposures, as the utilization of these measures will allow the validation of significant results across multiple studies. Another limitation to this EWAS design is the difficulty in determining whether associations occurred simply due to T2D diagnosis. For instance, the activity questions measured activity for the past month and did not include information on activity level during childhood or if activity level changed when T2D symptoms were experienced. It is possible that the individuals with T2D participated in less leisure and sport activity due to symptoms but had greater activity levels earlier in life. Similarly, the inverse association observed between T2D and carbohydrate intake may be reflective of individuals who are restricting carbohydrate intake due to T2D diagnosis, a common dietary treatment for the disease. This issue indicates the importance of gathering environmental variables that measure multiple points of an individual's lifetime. Additionally, this approach does not currently consider the full spectrum of environmental exposures. Limitations in the types of exposures assessed, and when they are collected, restricts thorough understanding of all the environmental components involved in the development of complex diseases such as T2D. Future incorporation of biological exposure data such as toxins and nutrients will provide additional data on the exposures associated with complex traits. Environment-wide association studies allow the testing of multiple environmental exposures for association with common disease. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for research using health record data, a novel use for this type of resource. Using this systematic EWAS approach, exposures will be identified as potential causative agents for complex traits. Significant associations can be investigated for gene-environment interactions. Incorporating genetic data will lead to a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to complex phenotypes, such as T2D Similar to the PheWAS method, the EWAS approach can be used to test for association between a diverse array of exposures and numerous phenotypes to discover the types of exposure that are associated with multiple traits. The search for interactions between environmental variables and genetic loci, as well as the independent exposures involved in multiple traits, will further elucidate the genetic and environmental architecture of complex human phenotypes."

An environment-wide association study for the identification of non-invasive factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus: Analysis based on the Henan Rural Cohort study. Diabetes research and clinical practice, 204, 110917. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2023.110917",2023,"An environment-wide association study for the identification of non-invasive factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus: Analysis based on the Henan Rural Cohort study. Aim: To explore the influencing factors of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the rural population of Henan Province and evaluate the predictive ability of non-invasive factors to T2DM. Methods: A total of 30,020 participants from the Henan Rural Cohort Study in China were included in this study. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set and a testing set with a 50:50 split for validation purposes. We used logistic regression analysis to investigate the association between 56 factors and T2DM in the training set (false discovery rate < 5 %) and significant factors were further validated in the testing set (P < 0.05). Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model was used to determine the ability of the non-invasive variables to classify T2DM individuals accurately and the importance ranking of these variables. Results: The overall population prevalence of T2DM was 9.10 %. After adjusting for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and body measure index (BMI), we identified 13 non-invasive variables and 6 blood biochemical indexes associated with T2DM in the training and testing dataset. The top three factors according to the GBM importance ranking were pulse pressure (PP), urine glucose (UGLU), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). The GBM model achieved a receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve of 0.837 with non-invasive variables and 0.847 for the full model. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that non-invasive variables that can be easily measured and quickly obtained may be used to predict T2DM risk in rural populations in Henan Province. 4. In this study, we discovered 13 non-invasive risk factors and 6 invasive risk factors that are associated with T2DM in the rural population of Henan Province. we constructed two predictive models for T2DM based on both non-invasive risk factors and all risk factors. We constructed two predictive models for T2DM based on both non-invasive risk factors and all risk factors. The identified variables were able to accurately differentiate T2DM, with a prediction accuracy of 0.837 based on non-invasive variables alone. The inclusion of invasive variables only slightly improved the accuracy to 0.847.At the 2.06 % pre-dicted risk cut-off, 75.0 % of people were classified as T2DM risk, and 96.5 % of people actually suffered from T2DM have been identified, with corresponding PPV 14.0 % and NPV 95.8 %, suggesting a strong ability to rule out T2DM in people who predicted negative. Prominent among these non-invasive risk factors were pulse pressure (PP), urine glucose (UGLU), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Hence, Using non-invasive pre-dictive tools for T2DM screening in rural regions may assist healthcare practitioners to identify high-risk individuals and implement early preventive measures for disease prevention. Our study revealed significant positive correlations between UGLU, UPRO, and T2DM risk in all our analyses. This could be because glycosuria production indicates the extent of hyperglycemia resulting from plasma glucose concentrations exceeding the renal glucose threshold [32]. It is noteworthy that milk and bean intake emerged as risk factors for T2DM in our analysis, contrary to previous findings. This could be attributed to the type of dairy products [35], fat content [36], and cooking methods of bean products [37]. Notably, absolute values of central granulocyte, basophil, and lymphocyte were positively correlated with T2DM, while that of monocyte, a leukocyte subtype, was a protective factor. This could be due to increased plasma glucose AGEs [38] and palmitic acid [39]levels in T2DM patients, which impair the body’s pathogen resistance and inflammation-clearing ca-pabilities, promoting chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, and consequently T2DM development [40]. Additionally, our findings regarding other variables associations with T2DM align with previous literature. This suggests that T2DM risk factors vary across populations, and future research should adopt comprehensive, multi-perspective approaches to understand the condition’s etiology and prevention strategies. Our study indicates the robust capability of the T2DM prediction model constructed based on non-invasive factors to effectively identify individuals at high risk of T2DM in the rural population of Henan Province. Currently, numerous predictive models for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have been developed, with most of these models incorporating factors such as age, gender, BMI, fasting blood glucose, insulin, and various other biochemical indicators. These models have consistently demonstrated robust predictive performance(AUC:0.72–0.86)[45–48]. A T2DM predictive model developed for the western region of China’s Xinjiang province demonstrated validation set results with an AUC of 0.865 for men and 0.815 for women[49], This model encompassed predictive factors including age, BMI, WC, TC, TG, and HDLC. Although we adjusted for age, gender, and BMI as covariates in the process of predictor selection and did not include them in our model, our model still achieved favorable predictive performance(AUC = 0.83 Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice 204 (2023) 110917 6(0.819,0.856)). A non-invasive predictive model for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with adult T2DM in Urumqi, China, exhibited promising disease detection capability (AUC: 0.755) and calibration. These findings provide further evidence that non-invasive variables, which can be obtained through self-reported questionnaires and simple examinations, may help medical workers working in remote rural areas assess the risk of T2DM and make diagnostic decisions. Our study demonstrated that PP, UGLU, and WHR were significant predictors of T2DM. Machine-learning models indicated that PP was the most influential predictor for T2DM occurrence. Increased PP was found to be independently related to an elevated risk of T2DM in Chinese adults. Additionally, PP had a higher potential for predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients compared to systolic blood pressure (SBP). PP represents the pulsatile component of blood flow and serves as an indicator of arterial stiffness from a patho-physiological perspective [53–54]. Longitudinal studies have shown that arterial stiffness precedes an increase in fasting blood glucose (FPG). UGLU, in combination with FPG, significantly improves T2DM screening compared to FPG alone. UGLU has been identified as an effective tool for identifying undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes in high-risk groups. With the development of urine glucose meters, UGLU measurement has become more accurate, objective, and sensitive, and may be used in large-scale T2DM screening in the general population. WHR has been identified as the best predictor of T2DM risk compared to body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) inprevious studies, possibly due to its provision of more information than classical anthropometric indicators [57]. Since WC and hip circumference are simple measurements that can be conducted by the general population, WHR is a useful tool for T2DM risk screening, particularly in remote areas with inadequate medical equipment [58–59]. Our study showed that these 19 variables related to T2DM could be Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice classified into five risk behavior clusters. These five categories are related to personal dietary habits and blood pressure, immune system, renal and metabolic functions. Previous studies have shown that hy-pertension is a risk factor for T2DM and accelerates the development of insulin resistance [60]. Regular blood pressure testing in the population that can reduce T2DM may be particularly important. Although the current research cannot confirm the causal relationship between the immune system [61], and renal dysfunction insulin resistance. Besides regular blood glucose detection, regular renal function tests among high-risk groups may help to screen for T2DM. Community workers should advocate a reasonable diet, control weight, exercise, and healthy lifestyle among the general population, and improve the overall awareness of diabetes prevention and treatment among the community population. This study has some important significance for public health practice and primary health workers. Our predictive model that combines these simple and easy-to-measure variables serves a complementary role as an aiding diagnostic tool, assisting medical professionals in rural places to identify individuals at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, facilitating early blood glucose screening, thereby contributing to the reduction of Type 2 diabetes incidence in rural areas. It is noteworthy that our disease prediction model does not aim to simultaneously identify all high-risk individuals within these regions. The widespread implementation and adoption of the predictive model may necessitate a time frame of up to 10 years or even longer. As a result, the burden on grassroots healthcare institutions arising from the identification of high-risk individuals for T2DM using our predictive model is not expected to be excessive. The strengths of this study included our analysis in which the  predictive value of non-invasive factors was evaluated in the rural population of Henan Province, China. The T2DM predictive model established on non-invasive factors demonstrated favorable forecasting efficacy. It is helpful for primary healthcare workers in rural places to identify early T2DM populations and take preventive measures to reduce the prevalence of T2DM. Our study is subjected to several limi- tations. Firstly, it is worth noting that our study did not include all non- invasive factors, such as exposure to noise pollution, however, our model also demonstrates favorable predictive efficacy. Second, there is a lack of external cohorts for the validation of the model’s performance. Nonetheless, within our analysis, a random selection of 20 % of in- dividuals was employed to assess the model’s performance. Finally, due to the cross-sectional design of our study, we cannot infer causal re-lationships and temporal associations of the disease. More longitudinal studies are needed in the future to confirm our current findings."

Journal of healthcare engineering, 2021, 9930985. https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9930985",2021,"Machine Learning Based Diabetes Classification and Prediction for Healthcare Applications. he remarkable advancements in biotechnology and public healthcare infrastructures have led to a momentous production of critical and sensitive healthcare data. By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications. In this paper, we have discussed an approach to assist the healthcare domain. The primary objective of this study is twofold. First, we proposed an MLP-based algorithm for diabetes classification and deep learning based LSTM for diabetes prediction. Second, we proposed an IOT-based hypothetical real-time diabetic monitoring system. The proposed theoretical diabetic monitoring system will use a smartphone, BLE-based sensor device, and machine learning based methods in the real-time data processing environment to predict BG levels and diabetes. The primary objective of the proposed system is to help the users monitor their vital signs using BLE-based sensor devices with the help of their smartphones.
Moreover, the proposed model will help the users to find out the risk of diabetes at a very early stage and help them gaining future predictions of their BG increase levels. For diabetic classification and prediction, MLP and LSTM are fine-tuned. The proposed approaches are evaluated on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. Both approaches are compared with state-of-the-art approaches and outperformed with an accuracy of 86.083% and 87.26%, respectively.
As future work, we plan to implement the android application for the proposed hypothetical diabetic monitoring system with the proposed classification and prediction approaches. Genetic algorithms can also be explored with the proposed prediction mechanism for better monitoring"

JMIR medical informatics, 8(7), e16850. https://doi.org/10.2196/16850",2020,"Predicting the Development of Type 2 Diabetes in a Large Australian Cohort Using Machine-Learning Techniques: Longitudinal Survey Study. Previous conventional models for the prediction of diabetes could be updated by incorporating the increasing amount of health data available and new risk prediction methodology. We aimed to develop a substantially improved diabetes risk prediction model using sophisticated machine-learning algorithms based on a large retrospective population cohort of over 230,000 people who were enrolled in the study during 2006-2017. We collected demographic, medical, behavioral, and incidence data for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in over 236,684 diabetes-free participants recruited from the 45 and Up Study. We predicted and compared the risk of diabetes onset in these participants at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years based on three machine-learning approaches and the conventional regression model. Overall, 6.05% (14,313/236,684) of the participants developed T2DM during an average 8.8-year follow-up period. The 10-year diabetes incidence in men was 8.30% (8.08%-8.49%), which was significantly higher (odds ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.32-1.41) than that in women at 6.20% (6.00%-6.40%). The incidence of T2DM was doubled in individuals with obesity (men: 17.78% [17.05%-18.43%]; women: 14.59% [13.99%-15.17%]) compared with that of nonobese individuals. The gradient boosting machine model showed the best performance among the four models (area under the curve of 79% in 3-year prediction and 75% in 10-year prediction). All machine-learning models predicted BMI as the most significant factor contributing to diabetes onset, which explained 12%-50% of the variance in the prediction of diabetes. The model predicted that if BMI in obese and overweight participants could be hypothetically reduced to a healthy range, the 10-year probability of diabetes onset would be significantly reduced from 8.3% to 2.8% (P<.001). A one-time self-reported survey can accurately predict the risk of diabetes using a machine-learning approach. Achieving a healthy BMI can significantly reduce the risk of developing T2DM. Our study is a retrospective cohort study of more than 230,000 Australians over a follow-up period spanning a decade. Several important findings can be highlighted. First, we confirmed that machine-learning models performed significantly better than the conventional regression model in predicting the risk of diabetes onset. Notably, the models were developed based solely on self-reported information that was ascertained at a single time point but still achieved 73%-80% accuracy for diabetes prediction for up to 10 years. Second, all machine-learning models consistently demonstrated that BMI is a key risk factor contributing to the onset of T2DM. Based on these results, we argue that a sophisticated machine-learning model is key for the risk prediction of T2DM onset. In our study, machine-learning models were demonstrated to be superior to the conventional regression model in diabetes risk prediction in a large population-based dataset. Further, the fact that our models were completely based on self-reported information in the absence of any biomarkers suggests the potential for self-assessment in individuals and primary surveillance of diabetes risk in the community. The model tracked over 230,000 Australian individuals for a duration of 10 years and is able to estimate the risk of diabetes development for each individual. Notably, the 10 strongest contributing factors explained over 74%-89% of the variation in diabetes risk. Compared with similar models that are also based on self-reported information, our model performed consistently better in predicting the risk of diabetes in both the short and long term. This provides further evidence that a simple and user-accessible self-assessment tool can be developed to project the risk of diabetes with robust accuracy, without the assistance of health care workers or need for biomarker sampling or measurement. On a population level, by using a big data platform, the collection of individual assessment surveys may inform the trends in the diabetes epidemic. This can potentially form an inexpensive user-driven online surveillance platform that surveys diabetes risk factors in a large population, which can in turn forecast the trend of the incidence of diabetes. This is potentially more advantageous than the passive hospital-based case report of diabetes diagnosis that inevitably falls behind the epidemic and population studies that are expensive and unsustainable. Our findings suggest a feasible method such as an electronic health platform for both self-assessment of diabetes risk in individuals and the monitoring of diabetes trends on a population level.
Our finding that BMI is the leading risk factor for T2DM risk was consistent across all machine-learning models. A previous study demonstrated that excessive BMI gain and earlier onset of overweight/obesity are associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes onset. Mokdad et alfurther demonstrated that being overweight increases the risk of diabetes by 2 fold, while obesity increases the diabetes risk by 3-7 fold. Consistent with previous reports, we found that BMI alone accounted for 25%-50% of the variance in diabetes risk. We further quantified the impact of BMI reduction on the risk of diabetes onset in several hypothetical scenarios. We predicted that reducing an individual’s BMI from “obese” to “overweight” would reduce their risk of diabetes in the short and long term by more than half. Further, if BMI could be changed from the “obese and overweight” to “healthy” range, the corresponding risk of diabetes could be reduced by almost two-thirds. This implies that interventions for diabetes prevention should prioritize weight control, especially for those in their late 60s and early 70s. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) global status report on noncommunicable diseases, 39% and 12.9% of adults aged 18 years or over in 2014 globally were overweight and obese, respectively, and the worldwide prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980. Actions to address overweight and obesity are critical to preventing T2DM, as advocated in the WHO report on diabetes. The WHO Global NCD Action Plan 2013–2020 listed halting the rise in diabetes and obesity as one of its voluntary global targets. Our findings are in line with these WHO reports and support their key recommendations.The key strengths of the current study include the utilization of a large cohort study dataset (>230,000 participants) with a long follow-up period, and the robust performance of our algorithm for diabetes risk prediction using machine-learning models. Several study limitations should also be noted. First, the analysis was based on a large population survey with information that is subject to self-report bias. Second, the incidence of diabetes in our study was not based on the actual diagnosis of diabetes but was instead inferred by the new use of diabetes-related medications as reported in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme database. This may have resulted in not identifying participants with early diabetes or prediabetes that were not on diabetic medications, and could have therefore underestimated the true diabetes incidence rate over the follow-up period. Nevertheless, one study based on 45 and Up data and linked clinical data proved that diabetes classification based on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme database is more accurate than clinical data. Third, questions related to eating habits in the 45 and Up Study were oversimplified and may not be comparable to standard nutritional surveys. We did not find any association between eating habits and diabetes in our study. Fourth, the absence of mortality data in our dataset implies that the T2DM risk in participants who died before its onset cannot be determined. Fifth, similar to other machine-learning algorithms, the gradient boosting machine model is likely to suffer from overfitting as it automatically removes less fit simulations during its optimization. Regularization parameters and processes such as grid search-tuned learning rate and cross-validation were utilized in this study to enhance the generality of the model. Future work will focus on further validating this model in an independent existing dataset before its official deployment."

Journal of personalized medicine, 12(6), 905. https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12060905",2022,"Predicting the Development of Type 2 Diabetes in a Large Australian Cohort Using Machine-Learning Techniques: Longitudinal Survey Study. Early identification of individuals at high risk of diabetes is crucial for implementing early intervention strategies. However, algorithms specific to elderly Chinese adults are lacking. The aim of this study is to build effective prediction models based on machine learning (ML) for the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Chinese elderly. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the health screening data of adults older than 65 years in Wuhan, China from 2018 to 2020. With a strict data filtration, 127,031 records from the eligible participants were utilized. Overall, 8298 participants were diagnosed with incident T2DM during the 2-year follow-up (2019–2020). The dataset was randomly split into training set (n = 101,625) and test set (n = 25,406). We developed prediction models based on four ML algorithms: logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Using LASSO regression, 21 prediction features were selected. The Random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to address the class imbalance, and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to calculate and visualize feature importance. Model performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The XGBoost model achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.7805, sensitivity = 0.6452, specificity = 0.7577, accuracy = 0.7503). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), education, exercise, gender, and waist circumference (WC) were the top five important predictors. This study showed that XGBoost model can be applied to screen individuals at high risk of T2DM in the early phrase, which has the strong potential for intelligent prevention and control of diabetes. The key features could also be useful for developing targeted diabetes prevention interventions. In this retrospective study, we applied four machine learning algorithms to build prediction models for the risk of incident T2DM among Chinese elderly. It is found that the XGBoost model with 21 features demonstrated the best performance for predicting T2DM. This suggested that the prediction model derived in the present study could be applied to screen out individuals at high risk of T2DM, which could benefit the prevention and control of diabetes. To date, the research of diabetes prediction models tended to focus on white populations, and Asian populations especially for the elderly have received relatively little attention. This study utilized a large longitudinal dataset obtained from Chinese elderly to establish prediction models for T2DM. The prediction results confirmed that the XGBoost model performed best with the highest AUC value of 0.7805 in predicting the probability that an individual develops T2DM. It was a good example of success for the XGBoost’s application in the research of diabetes risk prediction. This finding was consistent with earlier studies, which identified the good prediction power of the XGBoost model, with AUC values ranging from 0.8300 to 0.9680. Different from this study, a previous Korean population-based cohort study demonstrated that the ensemble models (e.g., stacking classifier) had better performance than the single models including XGBoost. A rural cohort study in Henan province of China showed good predictive efficiency for the prediction models of T2DM, with AUC values ranging from 0.811 to 0.872 using laboratory data. Compared with previous research, the AUC value in this study was relatively not satisfactory enough. A potential reason could be due to the differences of the study population and input features in the models, which could impact the predictive performance to some extent. Different from our study, the study population of prior studies were middle-aged adults and fewer predictors were applied in the prediction of diabetes. To our knowledge, this was the first study that targeted the elderly population (?65 years) in China to build predictive models for diabetes using machine learning techniques, which would have great implications for designing diabetes prevention focusing on the elderly. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques have been widely applied in the medical field, especially for prediction models for diabetes. It is worth noting that the advantages of machine learning models are well-documented empirically compared with traditional statistical methods, but its disadvantage is the lack of model interpretability. XGBoost was often considered as a black box model, because it tends to have better accuracy for predictions compared with linear models while it loses the model interpretability at the same time. Thus, we applied the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method developed by Lundberg and Lee to better explain the contribution of each feature to the model. This is crucial for healthcare workers to get over the model interpretability barrier to apply predictive models in clinical practice. Notably, the results of the feature importance analysis indicated the contribution of different feature to the model. These features such as FPG, education, exercise, gender, WC, etc., made substantial contributions to the prediction model. This was in accordance with the results observed in prior similar research. Early identification of key risk factors had important implications for the risk assessment and prevention of diabetes. Our model results identified that FPG was the most significant predictor of T2DM. Individuals with higher blood glucose would have a greater likelihood of developing diabetes. An explanation for this was that hyperglycemia was correlated with insulin resistance. As mentioned in the literature review, blood glucose was the main traditionally diabetes predictor and also widely used for diagnosis of diabetes. This indicated that blood glucose control plays a key role in the prevention of T2DM, especially for the elderly. As is shown in the present study, education and exercise showed negative associations with the risk of incident T2DM. Several studies have suggested that diabetes is associated with a low level of education. A cohort study among American adults has confirmed that educational level was linked to the onset of diabetes. Individuals with less than a high school educational level (hazard rate [HR] 1.58; 95% CI, 1.26–1.97) were more likely to develop diabetes. It is possible that people with higher education would have better health literacy, so they paid more attention to health management to prevent diabetes. Prior studies have also noted the key role of exercise and found that exercise intervention could decrease the risk of developing diabetes by 46%. The China Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study has identified the long-term effects of exercise interventions in reducing the incidence of T2DM. It was shown that exercise intervention groups had a 49% decreased incidence of T2DM (hazard rate ratio [HRR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31–0.83) over the past two decades. There is need for implementing diabetes prevention programs, emphasizing the importance of regular exercise, and focusing particularly on lower educated populations. In our study, another interesting finding was that men were more likely to develop T2DM compared to women, which agreed with results from earlier studies. Previous meta-analysis also demonstrated that gender was a dependent risk factor of T2DM in mainland China. It found that the female gender (odds ratio [OR], 0.87, 95% CI, 0.78–0.97) was significantly negatively associated with the risk of T2DM. This could be explained by the fact that most risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity) were more prevalent in men than women. Therefore, more attention should be paid to men. As a measure of central/abdominal obesity, WC was also proved to be a strong predictor of T2DM. The significance of WC has been illustrated in other studies. A 13-year prospective cohort study reported that a higher WC was linked to an increased risk of diabetes and the age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) across quintiles of WC were 1.0, 2.0, 2.7, 5.0, and 12.0, respectively. Our findings further supported that the routine measurement of waist circumference would help clinical workers make preventive recommendations for individuals at high risk of diabetes. Diabetes has become a major human health challenge and a global health burden because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. The XGBoost prediction model established in this study showed promising performance. It had important public health implications, which could help clinicians screen out populations with a high risk of diabetes. The key features identified in this study not only captured each person’s socio-demographic variables, but also medical history, anthropometric and clinical laboratory variables, which could be effective for formulating and implementing targeted diabetes prevention strategies to reduce the disease burden. Despite of the above encouraging findings, the current study has several limitations. First, only the participants who attended both the baseline survey and 2 -year follow-up were included in this study, which might potentially introduce a selection bias and limit the generalizability of the results. Second, some important risk factors of T2DM such as HbA1c, and insulin were not accounted for in the prediction models due to lack of relevant data. Third, some diabetes cases would be misclassified as non-T2DM because the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was not included for the diagnosis of T2DM. However, the high cost and large sample size make it infeasible and difficult to perform oral glucose tolerance tests for all participants. Fourth, we only performed internal validation, and these prediction models need to be further validated in an external validation set in future work. Moreover, further work is warranted to consider auto encoder, to extract the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) features automatically, which can improve the classification efficiency of T2DM to some extent."

Diabetes care, 29(8), 1872–1877. https://doi.org/10.2337/dc05-2141",2006,"A risk score for predicting incident diabetes in the Thai population. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a risk score to predict people at high risk of diabetes in Thailand.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A Thai cohort of 2,677 individuals, aged 35–55 years, without diabetes at baseline, was resurveyed after 12 years. Logistic regression models were used to identify baseline risk factors that predicted the incidence of diabetes; a simple model that included only those risk factors as significant (P < 0.05) when adjusted for each other was developed. The coefficients from this model were transformed into components of a diabetes score. This score was tested in a Thai validation cohort of a different 2,420 individuals.
RESULTS—A total of 361 individuals developed type 2 diabetes in the exploratory cohort during the follow-up period. The significant predictive variables in the simple model were age, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, and history of diabetes in parents or siblings A cutoff score of 6 of 17 produced the optimal sum of sensitivity (77%) and specificity (60%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.74. Adding impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance status to the model slightly increased the AUC to 0.78; adding low HDL cholesterol and/or high triglycerides barely improved the model. The validation cohort demonstrated similar results.
CONCLUSIONS—A simple diabetes risk score, based on a set of variables not requiring laboratory tests, can be used for early intervention to delay or prevent the disease in Thailand. Adding impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance or triglyceride and HDL cholesterol status to this model only modestly improves the predictive ability. In the present study we develop a practical tool for prediction of diabetes incidence in Thailand. The variables included are age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, history of hypertension, and history of diabetes in parents or siblings. The simple model without laboratory tests is almost as good as models that include IFG, glucose intolerance, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides. The simple model is attractive because it is noninvasive, more convenient, and less expensive compared with the models that rely upon blood tests. The scoring rule based on the simple model performed well when it was validated in an independent cohort. The risk score method for identifying high-risk people is practical for a primary medical care setting and for a layperson to perform self-assessment. The high-risk individuals identified will benefit from receiving health education and having the opportunity to engage in healthy lifestyles at an early stage so as to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. It is generally recommended that individuals with high risk have a fasting blood test, and, nowadays, the test is available in most primary health care settings in Thailand. Combining the information on IFG with the simple diabetes risk score increased the predictive ability in the validation cohort. This might indicate that IFG is an influential predictor in populations with a high prevalence of IFG.
Other risk scores have been developed elsewhere, but few were developed from a cohort study design in which incident rather than prevalent cases were used. Among those with a cohort design, virtually all were developed in Caucasians and contain variables that may not be readily available in other populations. For instance, the Finnish diabetes risk modelrequires knowledge of a history of high blood glucose. The model by Stern et al.includes biochemical data on blood glucose, total and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The inclusion of blood test data might not be practical in countries such as Thailand, where health care resources are limited, and such tests are not easily affordable. However, the current study lacks information on certain easily measurable risk factors that may be important predictors of diabetes, such as physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Results are given for both sexes combined, because of the small number of events among women (67 in the exploratory cohort and 27 in the validation cohort). This, unfortunately, precludes the chance to investigate potentially important sex differences in the optimum risk score.
Among the modifiable risk factors that played a substantial role in previous studies was obesity, measured by BMI or waist circumference. In the present study, both BMI and waist circumference were found to increase diabetes risk at cutoff points suggested for Asian populations that are lower than those used for people in Western countries. HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are components of the metabolic syndrome, which is related to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk. We did not find that low HDL cholesterol or high triglyceride levels add more predictive ability than the model with fasting blood glucose or IGT. A recent study showed that a diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome is not superior to a diabetes risk score in the prediction of diabetes.
Importantly, this study, unlike many previous ones, included a validation test of the diabetes prediction score in another population. Although the validation cohort was drawn from the same workforce, it contained an entirely different set of individuals drawn from a wider geographical area. The results of the validation confirmed that the risk score performs well in the prediction of diabetes. However, at the score that best defined diabetes in the exploratory cohort, it slightly overestimated the risk of diabetes in the validation set. This result might be due to the shorter follow-up in the validation cohort compared with that for the exploratory cohort. However, some degree of poorer fit is expected, because all scores are more likely to perform well in the study within which they were developed. The optimal score in the validation cohort was only 1 point higher than in the exploratory cohort, further confirming the utility of the score derived here.
The present study provides a risk score based on a specific population in Asia. The predictive performance and discriminative ability of the score is relatively comparable to those developed among Caucasians. We were unable to validate the Finnish diabetes risk score or other scores with our data because certain information such as physical activity and vegetable or fruit consumption used in those studies was not available in our data. However, one study proved that those score rules yielded low accuracy when applied to another population, probably due to the differences in population characteristics. Nevertheless, future researchers might investigate more about the generalizability of these score rules across countries.
In summary, the simple diabetes risk score developed here can be applied in primary medical care practice and by the public as a self-assessment tool to identify people at high risk of diabetes. People with a high score should be referred for further blood tests and changes to a healthier lifestyle for primary prevention."

BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 338, b880. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b880",2009,"Predicting risk of type 2 diabetes in England and Wales: prospective derivation and validation of QDScore. Objective To develop and validate a new diabetes risk algorithm (the QDScore) for estimating 10 year risk of acquiring diagnosed type 2 diabetes over a 10 year time period in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population. The QDScore is the first diabetes prediction algorithm developed and validated by using routinely collected data to predict the 10 year risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Our final model includes both deprivation and ethnicity as well as age, sex, smoking, treated hypertension, body mass index, family history of diabetes, current treatment with corticosteroids, and previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. The QDScore does not require any laboratory testing or clinical measurements and so can be used in many settings, including by individual members of the public who have access to a computer. This risk prediction tool might be used to identify and proactively intervene in people identified as having an increased risk. This algorithm, like other algorithms that predict cardiovascular disease, relies on routinely collected data and has the advantage that it is readily implementable. Furthermore, it is likely to reduce, rather than exacerbate, widespread and persistent health inequalities. The QDScore performed well compared with the Cambridge risk score. Assuming that the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of suitable interventions shown in randomised controlled trials extend to unselected patients from primary care,7 the QDScore could be used to identify patients at increased risk of diabetes who might benefit from interventions to reduce their risk. The traditional method for identifying patients at increased risk of type 2 diabetes has involved the detection of impaired glucose tolerance requiring an inconvenient and expensive oral glucose tolerance test. Targeted screening of higher risk groups has been proposed as a more cost effective solution, as the risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes overlap considerably. Less expensive and more practical methods of identifying patients at increased risk are needed; these should ideally be based on models developed from contemporaneous data in ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations obtained from the clinical setting in which these models will subsequently be applied. Simple clinical models using readily available data can offer similar discrimination to more complex models using laboratory data or biomarkers, and clinical models that do not need clinical measurements may have a further utility in settings where clinical measurements are not available or are too costly to collect. UK datasets derived from family practices have the advantage of having large and broadly representative populations with historical data tracking back well over a decade in most practices. These databases also contain data on many of the key variables known to be associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, such as age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, family history of diabetes, treated hypertension, current use of corticosteroids, and social deprivation. Deprivation is not only strongly associated with increased prevalence of diabetes and diabetes related risk factors such as diet, obesity, and smoking but is also associated with poorer outcomes and intermediate measures such as achievement of lipid targets. Design Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from 355 general practices in England and Wales to develop the score and from 176 separate practices to validate the score. Participants 2?540?753 patients aged 25-79 in the derivation cohort, who contributed 16?436?135 person years of observation and of whom 78?081 had an incident diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; 1?232?832 patients (7?643?037 person years) in the validation cohort, with 37?535 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. Outcome measures A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate effects of risk factors in the derivation cohort and to derive a risk equation in men and women. The predictive variables examined and included in the final model were self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current use of corticosteroids; the outcome of interest was incident diabetes recorded in general practice records. Measures of calibration and discrimination were calculated in the validation cohort. A fourfold to fivefold variation in risk of type 2 diabetes existed between different ethnic groups. Compared with the white reference group, the adjusted hazard ratio was 4.07 (95% confidence interval 3.24 to 5.11) for Bangladeshi women, 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59) for Bangladeshi men, 2.15 (1.84 to 2.52) for Pakistani women, and 2.54 (2.20 to 2.93) for Pakistani men. Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher hazard ratios than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women had an increased risk compared with the corresponding white reference group. In the validation dataset, the model explained 51.53% (95% confidence interval 50.90 to 52.16) of the variation in women and 48.16% (47.52 to 48.80) of that in men. The risk score showed good discrimination, with a D statistic of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) in women and 1.97 (1.95 to 2.00) in men. The model was well calibrated. The QDScore is the first risk prediction algorithm to estimate the 10 year risk of diabetes on the basis of a prospective cohort study and including both social deprivation and ethnicity. The algorithm does not need laboratory tests and can be used in clinical settings and also by the public through a simple web calculator . Particular strengths of our study are the use of a large representative population from a validated database, our prospective cohort design, and the substantial numbers of patients with self assigned ethnicity for use in the analysis. We have modelled interactions with age and included these in the final model, so our algorithm takes account of the differential effect of three key variables (family history of diabetes, body mass index, and smoking) at different ages. Another important strength of the QDScore is that all the variables used in the algorithm will either be known to an individual patient or are collected as part of routine clinical practice and recorded within an individual patient’s primary healthcare record in most economically developed countries. This means that the algorithm can be used by patients for self assessment in a web based calculator similar to the one available for self assessment of cardiovascular disease Alternatively, it can be implemented within clinical computer systems used in primary care and be used to stratify the practice population (aged 25-79) for risk on a continuing basis without the need for manual entry of data. Although no widely agreed thresholds for classification of patients at “high risk” exist, the QDScore could act as a basis for a systematic programme to identify patients at increased risk for intervention or to aid earlier diagnosis. Importantly, appropriate weighting for ethnicity and social deprivation should furthermore help to avoid widening health inequalities associated with introduction of systematic programmes of disease prevention activities. Clinicians had recorded our predictor variables on the clinical computer system before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, so these will not have been subject to recall bias. We have used the entire population registered with the QResearch practices contributing to the database from England and Wales. Consequently, the population is unlikely to be affected by selection bias, in contrast to the selection bias that inevitably occurs when patients are individually recruited to clinical cohorts or clinical trials. We have included a proxy measure of material deprivation, the Townsend score, which is based on the patient’s postcode at the level of the output area (corresponding to around 150 households) and is a composite score comprising lack of a car, unemployment, over-crowding, and non-home ownership. Some people living within an output area will not be typical of the other residents, resulting in some misclassification. Deprivation is likely to be associated with other factors known to increase risk of diabetes, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and increased alcohol intake, and so will account at least in part for some of the effect of these factors. Lastly, we included treated hypertension as a predictor as both blood pressure and some antihypertensive drugs (such as thiazides) may have contributed to the increased hazard ratios associated with this variable. We used self assigned ethnicity in our analyses, as reported by patients to their general practices, which has advantages over analyses in which ethnicity is assigned by an informant rather than the patient, is imputed geographically, or is related to country of birth. The last of these is particularly problematic as increasing numbers of people from minority ethnic groups are now being born in the UK. We have also been able to disaggregate the South Asian groups and report on them separately, which answers concerns with studies that tend to combine them into one group when they differ in risk factor exposure, disease rates, and outcomes. One important limitation is that only one quarter of patients overall had self assigned ethnicity recorded. Among those with a recorded value, 13.66% were recorded as from a minority ethnic group, which is higher than the estimated figure for 2006 based on the 2001 census, indicating over-representation of practices from ethnically diverse areas, that practices in ethnically diverse areas are more likely to record ethnicity, or most likely a combination of both. We have assumed that where patients have self assigned ethnicity recorded (as Bangladeshi, for example) this is accurate and the patient was indeed Bangladeshi. Where patients did not have ethnicity recorded, we have assumed they were white. Any misclassification arising from these assumptions is most likely to affect the reference category of “white or not recorded,” but because of the mix of the populations of England and Wales, less than 7% of such patients are likely to be from a non-white ethnic group. This misclassification error is likely to be non-differential and if so will tend to underestimate the relative effect of ethnicity on risk of type 2 diabetes rather than generating spurious associations. Misclassification would also tend to reduce levels of discrimination and underestimate risk in some misclassified patients. We restricted all values of variables in the model to those that had been recorded in the person’s electronic healthcare record before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (or before censoring for those who did not develop type 2 diabetes) in order to avoid recording bias."

Optimizing strategies to identify high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Frontiers in endocrinology, 14, 1166147. https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1166147",2023,"Optimizing strategies to identify high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.The success of diabetes prevention based on early treatment depends on high-quality screening. This study compared the diagnostic properties of currently recommended screening strategies against alternative score-based rules to identify those at high risk of developing diabetes.The study used data from ELSA-Brasil, a contemporary cohort followed up for a mean (standard deviation) of 7.4 (0.54) years, to develop risk functions with logistic regression to predict incident diabetes based on socioeconomic, lifestyle, clinical, and laboratory variables. We compared the predictive capacity of these functions against traditional pre-diabetes cutoffs of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) alone or combined with recommended screening questionnaires. Presenting FPG > 100 mg/dl predicted 76.6% of future cases of diabetes in the cohort at the cost of labeling 40.6% of the sample as high risk. If FPG testing was performed only in those with a positive American Diabetes Association (ADA) questionnaire, labeling was reduced to 12.2%, but only 33% of future cases were identified. Scores using continuously expressed clinical and laboratory variables produced a better balance between detecting more cases and labeling fewer false positives. They consistently outperformed strategies based on categorical cutoffs. For example, a score composed of both clinical and laboratory data, calibrated to detect a risk of future diabetes ?20%, predicted 54% of future diabetes cases, labeled only 15.3% as high risk, and, compared to the FPG ? 100 mg/dl strategy, nearly doubled the probability of future diabetes among screen positives. Currently recommended screening strategies are inferior to alternatives based on continuous clinical and laboratory variables. We compared different screening strategies for diabetes in adults ? 35 years using easily obtainable clinical variables and laboratory results. Our findings showed that risk scores combining clinical variables and glycemic measures expressed continuously outperformed traditional laboratory-based categorical approaches and the two-step categorical approaches frequently recommended in national screening programs. Combining a continuously expressed FPG with clinical variables resulted in the largest gain in accuracy. Including additional laboratory results produced some further improvement. While all strategies identified considerably more false than true positives, those based on continuously expressed variables had a more balanced mix between greater future case detection and less false-positive labeling. Finally, using two-step strategies, with the first step evaluating only clinical variables to identify those initially at the highest risk and the second step adding laboratory testing only for those identified, considerably reduced the need for laboratory testing. Three major national programs of diabetes prevention have defined specific rules to label high risk and initiate preventive intervention. In the United States, the CDC recommends lifestyle counseling for overweight individuals at high risk based on the ADA questionnaire, an ADA lab cutoff, or having a previous pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service recommends intervention for those positive with the two-step NICE screening strategy. The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) recommends using a score of ?15 points on the FINDRISC questionnaire to identify high risk while also considering at high risk those with OGTT results above WHO cutoffs or a history of either coronary heart disease or previous gestational diabetes. Our findings indicate that the UK/NICE and especially the CDC/ADA approaches label a relatively high percentage of the sample as high risk, producing many referrals, a significant fraction of whom will not develop diabetes in the subsequent decade. Additionally, as shown in Figure 3 , the approaches using ADA laboratory cutoffs, the ADA questionnaire, or both are internally inconsistent. Directly applied ADA glycemic testing labeled nearly 50% as high risk, but the ADA questionnaire labeled only 18% and the two-step approach only 13%. While the directly applied laboratory testing identified ~80% of cases, the questionnaire and two-step approaches identified little more than one-third of cases. The Finnish approach to screening, which sums those meeting other entry criteria with those presenting a high FINDRISC score, will likely also label a relatively high percentage as high risk and produce many false positives. Additionally, the two-step categorical strategies involving questionnaires and laboratory testing, as recommended by U.S. and U.K. authorities, were inferior to a similar continuous variable risk score as shown in the right panels of the figure. The continuous variable score labeled a smaller fraction of the population as at high risk than all but the ADA two-step strategy and produced a greater probability of those so labeled going on to develop diabetes than any of the other approaches. As has been noted, almost all cost-effectiveness studies of screening followed by lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes have been based on intensive interventions in non-community clinical trial settings. The effectiveness shown in these studies diminishes with their translation to community settings with less intensive interventions. With the use of the nationally recommended screening approaches, community programs also frequently recruit participants at lower risk of incident diabetes than those of the original clinical trials. This combination of a lower effectiveness of the intervention and a lower a priori probability of participants developing diabetes can markedly reduce the gains of screening. Lifestyle intervention in community settings, primarily in North America, has been estimated to prevent diabetes in only 3% of those enrolled. Improved titration of high-risk labeling through full use of clinical and laboratory information would improve the absolute probability of preventing diabetes through early detection. Hopefully, identifying additional influential risk factors from dietary, proteomic, DNA methylation, or metabolomic sources will permit further improvement of prediction. However, this gain may come at the cost of more sophisticated and thus more time-consuming and expensive strategies. Further, future advances in understanding the role of diet  and other factors in the pathogenesis of diabetes and in leading those with unhealthy habits to modify their human behavior will permit refinement in dietary and other lifestyle interventions. The use of continuous variable screening strategies, here documented to be superior, as additionally found by another recent study, combined with patient preferences, seems more consistent with the current vision of precision and personalized medicine. To that end, Table presents practical, clinically relevant implications derived from our study. Frequent rescreening should mitigate the concern that the continuous variable rules shown here will detect fewer future cases than current ADA one-step approaches. The ADA recommends testing adults over 35 or presenting risk factors every 3 years and those with previously detected pre-diabetes every year. A potential limitation to our study is that our rules using HbA1c performed relatively poorly, suggesting that greater laboratory error in HbA1c determination, although not reflected in our evaluation of its reliability coefficient, could have been present. Such imprecision could have led to underestimating the benefit of including HbA1c in strategies. Additionally, as in all evaluations of clinical predictive rules, our results are based on our sample’s pretest probability—the probability of developing diabetes over a 7.5-year follow-up. Settings with considerably greater or lesser incidence would need to calibrate our rules to their population’s risk of developing diabetes. However, as shown by the Global Burden of Disease Study, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is not greatly different in Brazil than in most other parts of the world.Our study presents several strengths. Its outcome of future incident diabetes and its focus on the most relevant screening metrics permit clinically relevant, head-to-head comparisons of different strategies. Our ascertainment of diabetes required confirmation, approximating it to the clinical definition, giving our findings greater generalizability. Standardized collection of data and centralized laboratory measurement add quality and precision to our results. Our relatively large sample size allows for more precise estimates of diagnostic properties. Rates of obesity and central obesity and other diabetes risk factors in ELSA-Brasil, being a contemporary cohort, are more in line with their current prevalence, permitting more easily generalizable clinical scores. Finally, our provision of an online calculator permits immediate use of findings."

To examine whether glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test would be a suitable screening tool for detecting high-risk subjects for diabetes compared to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) according to accompanied central obesity. In this prospective population-based cohort study, both OGTT and HbA1c tests were performed and continued every 2 years up to 12 years among individuals with non-diabetic state at baseline (aged 40 to 69 years, n=7,512). Incident diabetes was established by a doctor, HbA1c ?6.5%, and/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ?126 mg/dL, and/or 2-hour postprandial glucose (2hPG) level based on OGTT ?200 mg/dL. Discriminative capacities of high HbA1c (?5.7%) versus high 2hPG (?140 mg/dL) for predicting incident diabetes were compared using Cox-proportional hazard regression and C-index. During the median 11.5 years of follow-up period, 1,341 (17.6%) developed diabetes corresponding to an incidence of 22.1 per 1,000 person-years. Isolated high 2hPG was associated with higher risk for incident diabetes (hazard ratio [HR], 4.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.56 to 5.17) than isolated high HbA1c (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 2.40 to 3.26; P<0.05). In addition, high 2hPG provided better discriminatory capacity than high HbA1c (C-index 0.79 vs. 0.75, P<0.05). Meanwhile, in subjects with central obesity, the HR (3.95 [95% CI, 3.01 to 5.18] vs. 2.82 [95% CI, 2.30 to 3.46]) and discriminatory capacity of incident diabetes (C-index 0.75 vs. 0.75) between two subgroups became comparable.Even though the overall inferior predictive capacity of HbA1c test than OGTT, HbA1c test might plays a complementary role in identifying high risk for diabetes especially in subjects with central obesity with increased sensitivity. In this population-based cohort study, the different glycemic categories based on OGTT and HbA1c test showed that each glycemic parameter represent different clinical phenotypes. Individuals with high 2hPG had a higher risk of developing diabetes, regardless of the HbA1c level. In addition, 2hPG level had greater discriminatory capacity than HbA1c level. However, when diagnosed as prediabetes through HbA1c test, the number of subjects corresponding to actual IGT increased in obese population as the sensitivity of HbA1c test increases. As a result, the risk of incident diabetes and the predictive capacity between isolated IGT and isolated high HbA1c became comparable in obese population. Different glycemic categories (measurements of FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c) probably reflect diverse pathophysiological features of glucose metabolism and the different clinical, socioeconomic characteristics. In this study population, the subgroup with isolated IGT had fewer risk factors associated with diabetes compared with those carrying isolated high HbA1c levels (5.7% to 6.4%). Based on different clinical/anthropometric characteristics according to each diagnostic criteria, neither HbA1c test nor OGTT alone facilitated the detection of high-risk population and the accompanying risk factors to predict the risk of diabetes. Two tests (HbA1c and OGTT) can be used to measure different pathophysiological aspects of dysglycemia and a single positive result does not establish the accompanying risk factors and clinical phenotypes of diabetes.The concordance between 2hPG and HbA1c levels was higher in obese population regardless of whether the BMI criterion or the WC criterion was adopted in our study. In addition, the sensitivity and PPV of HbA1c for prediabetes compared with OGTT also increased in obese individuals than in non-obese individuals. Increased oxidative stress in obesity might explain elevated HbA1c levels at a given glycemic level in obese population. In the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study, the sensitivity of HbA1c criteria (5.7% to 6.4%) for prediabetes increased with increasing BMI (67.8% in obese subjects [BMI ?30 kg/m2] vs. 19.9% in overweight subjects [BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2]), but this trend was not observed in IGT criteria (60.0% in obese subjects vs. 58.1% in overweight subjects). In the Spanish non-diabetic community study, the prevalence of prediabetes was affected by BMI when the HbA1c criteria was applied but not in FPG criteria. A pooled analysis of global surveillance of diabetes prevalence showed that the relationship between glucose-based and HbA1c-based prevalence of diabetes was partly related to participants’ age and the presence of obesity, and the prevalence based on HbA1c increased with age, national income, and mean BMI. Interestingly, among centrally obese population, the risk of incident T2DM in prediabetes defined by HbA1c test alone became comparable to that of OGTT alone. In addition, the additional predictive performance of HbA1c and OGTT tests for diabetes was not different. Considering the general higher sensitivity of OGTT compared with HbA1c test in defining the high-risk population for diabetes, a higher accordance between HbA1c and 2hPG based on OGTT in obese subjects might increase the predictive power of HbA1c-based model compared with OGTT-based model. However, the findings do not warrant substitution of HbA1c for OGTT to determine the high risk for diabetes in obese population. Otherwise, it is necessary to recognize that the predictive power and the risk of diabetes based on HbA1c criteria may differ depending on the presence of central obesity. In interpreting the HbA1c test, an additional OGTT may be especially needed for risk analysis in non-obese subjects, even though the HbA1c is high (5.7% to 6.4%). However, if the obese subjects are considered at risk based on the HbA1c test, appropriate lifestyle modifications and drug therapy can be considered without additional confirmatory tests.We acknowledge both the strengths and limitations of the study. This study has several strengths. A community-based longitudinal cohort study of middle-aged adults was conducted and the association between different glycemic parameters and incident diabetes was evaluated. In addition, information based on a large number of confounding factors including socioeconomic, anthropometric, and laboratory traditional risk factors were adjusted in the study. Glycemic parameters such as HbA1c test and OGTT were evaluated simultaneously and the performance of HbA1c was compared with 2hPG instead of FPG. Furthermore, based on this nationwide sample of urban/rural area population, subjects with anemia or hemoglobinopathies were excluded to validate the accuracy of HbA1c, which was affected by red cell metabolism. However, the study findings from the Korean national cohort cannot be generalized to other races/ethnicities. We included subjects aged 40 to 69 years and excluded younger population. In addition, the longitudinal cohort observational study did not elucidate the causal relationship between different glycemic indices and incident diabetes. A further study is needed to evaluate the causal relationship. In conclusion, the overall risk of future diabetes and the diagnostic performance of HbA1c test for identifying high risk subjects were inferior to OGTT, but became comparable among obese subjects as the sensitivity of HbA1c test increases. Depending on whether or not subjects are accompanied by central obesity, it may be helpful in determining whether an additional confirmatory test should be performed after the HbA1c test."

HbA1c Cutoff Point of 5.9% Better Identifies High Risk of Progression to Diabetes among Chinese Adults: Results from a Retrospective Cohort Study. Journal of diabetes research, 2018, 7486493. https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/7486493",2018,"HbA1c Cutoff Point of 5.9% Better Identifies High Risk of Progression to Diabetes among Chinese Adults: Results from a Retrospective Cohort Study. This article performed a retrospective cohort study to estimate the annual incidence rates of diabetes and to assess the utility of HbA1c as a predictor for progression to diabetes in Chinese community adults aged 40 years or older. In all, 2778 nondiabetic subjects (including 1901 women) underwent HbA1c testing and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements at baseline and after 3 years. Diabetes and prediabetes were defined using the WHO criteria. The HbA1c cutoff points were evaluated to predict the future risks of diabetes. Relative risk (RR) was calculated using the chi-square test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive efficiency of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2?hr postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG), and HbA1c for progression to diabetes. A superior cutoff point was defined as the point on the ROC curve with a larger Youden index. Overall, 7.5% (210/2778) of the subjects progressed to diabetes, yielding an annual 2.5% diabetes incidence rate. Additionally, 4.5% (100/2227) of the subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 19.6% (110/561) of the subjects with prediabetes progressed to diabetes, and the relative risk of progression to diabetes was 5.188 times higher in subjects with prediabetes than in subjects with NGT (p < 0.001). Compared to subjects with HbA1c values???5.6%, the RRs of progression to diabetes in subjects whose HbA1c ranged from 5.7 to 5.8%, 5.9 to 6.2%, 6.3 to 6.4%, and ?6.5% were 1.165, 2.582, 5.732, and 16.619, respectively. However, the RRs for subjects with HbA1c ranging from 5.7 to 5.8% and those with HbA1c???5.6% did not differ significantly (p = 0.615). The AUCs for predicting diabetes after 3 years by FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c were 0.752 (95% confidence interval 0.718–0.787), 0.710 (95% confidence interval 0.671–0.748), and 0.756 (95% confidence interval 0.720–0.793), respectively. The HbA1c cutoff point of 5.9% (sensitivity of 0.771 and specificity of 0.580) may better identify individuals at high risk of progression to diabetes than the 5.7% value (sensitivity of 0.862 and specificity of 0.371) due to the former's larger Youden index of 0.351, which exceeded the indices for FPG and 2hPG. The use of HbA1c values???5.9% may provide greater accuracy in evaluating the risk of progression to diabetes and identify individuals with prediabetes with greater reliability among Chinese adults.The present study harmonized a baseline survey in 2012 and a 3-year follow-up completed in 2015 among Chinese community adults aged 40–90 years. Of the 2778 nondiabetic subjects at baseline, 7.5% progressed to diabetes, which yielded an annual diabetes incidence rate of 2.5%. The 3-year cumulative incidence rates of diabetes were clearly higher in our study than those in another cross-sectional 3-year follow-up study conducted in China (7.5% versus 4.98%), which might be attributed to the number of subjects aged 40 years or older who participated in the present study. Moreover, the relative risk of progression to diabetes in subjects with IGR was significantly higher than in subjects with NGT. Therefore, early screening and intervention for prediabetes are vital efforts to prevent or delay progression to diabetes. Although HbA1c, FPG, and 2hPG values have been recommended as screening tests for prediabetes, the optimal predictor of diabetes development has not been determined thus far, particularly for different races. Additionally, some controversy exists regarding the criteria used to define prediabetes. Currently, the most popular prediabetes diagnostic criteria in China are those of the WHO. Clearly, the ADA FPG cutoff point of 5.6?mmol/L identifies more people with prediabetes than the WHO FPG cutoff point of 6.1?mmol/L. However, the accurate identification of those individuals at highest risk is salient along with the avoidance of inappropriate or excessive diagnosis of these conditions. Therefore, an FPG value of 6.1?mmol/L was used as the cutoff point for prediabetes in this study. Furthermore, although various cutoff levels of HbA1c have been suggested to screen for diabetes, greater consensus regarding the optimal level is required, particularly for different ethnicities. In China, however, HbA1c has not been widely recognized for diagnosing prediabetes. Our previous cross-sectional study proposed an HbA1c cutoff point of 6.3% to diagnose diabetes and 5.9% to diagnose prediabetes in Chinese adults. To evaluate whether HbA1c might be an optimal predictor for progression to diabetes applicable to Chinese adults, we conducted this retrospective cohort study. Recent longitudinal studies using HbA1c to predict future diabetes risks have yielded various results. For example, a US study reported that elevated HbA1c was associated with an increased likelihood of diabetes in older adults, which was also confirmed in Indian and Caucasian adults. Studies in Japan, Korea, and Spain consistently reported that the predictive value of progression to diabetes assessed by HbA1c was similar to that assessed by IFG or IGT alone. In children moreover, a study of American Indians showed that HbA1c was a useful predictor of diabetes risk and might be used to identify prediabetes with the same predictive value as FPG and 2hPG. According to the latest analysis from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, prediabetes defined using the ADA HbA1c cutoff may improve the identification of people at risk for major health complications over the subsequent 10 years compared with prediabetes defined by glucose-based parameters. Interestingly, we found no significantly higher risk of developing diabetes in nondiabetic subjects whose HbA1c values ranged from 5.7 to 5.8% compared to subjects whose HbA1c values were ?5.6%, which did not support the ADA-recommended HbA1c value of 5.7% for prediabetes screening in Chinese individuals. Moreover, the ROC curve in the present study showed that an HbA1c value???5.9% had a higher predictive value of progression to diabetes than an HbA1c value???5.7%. These present study findings confirmed an HbA1c value of 5.9% as a superior cutoff point for prediabetes. Additionally, we observed that both the FPG concentration of 6.1–6.9?mmol/L and 2hPG concentration of 7.8–11.0?mmol/L had high specificity and low sensitivity for predicting future diabetes risks. In contrast, HbA1c showed high sensitivity and low specificity whether the cutoff point was 5.7% or 5.9%. Therefore, HbA1c and blood glucose used together may efficiently identify subjects who are likely to progress to diabetes and thereby permit early intervention. Although this conclusion is supported by published findings, it requires further study in Chinese populations. Of course, our study had some limitations. First, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be completely eliminated because of the epidemiological nature of our investigation. Moreover, although the HbA1c assay was performed at the same laboratory using standardized methods, we did not examine other blood cell parameters, which might have excluded some conditions that possibly affected the HbA1c results, such as hemoglobinopathies and anemia. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate an indicator to identify subjects at high risk of developing diabetes rather than to detect individuals with prediabetes using different criteria. In this regard, HbA1c performed better than FPG and 2hPG, and an HbA1c cutoff point of 5.9% had a higher predictive value for such risk than the 5.7% value recommended by the ADA. Therefore, we conclude that HbA1c values???5.9% may be used to more accurately evaluate risk for progression to diabetes among Chinese adults and may identify subjects with prediabetes more reliably."

Prediction or early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial for populations with high risk of diabetes. In this study, we assessed the ability of five popular classifiers (J48, AdaboostM1, SMO, Bayes Net, and Naïve Bayes) to identify individuals with diabetes based on nine non-invasive and easily obtained clinical features, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work stress, and salty food preference. A total of 4205 data entries were obtained from annual physical examination reports for adults in the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University during January–April 2017. Weka data mining software was used to identify the best algorithm for diabetes classification. The results indicate that decision tree classifier J48 has the best performance (accuracy?=?0.9503, precision?=?0.950, recall?=?0.950, F-measure?=?0.948, and AUC?=?0.964). The decision tree structure shows that age is the most significant feature, followed by family history of diabetes, work stress, BMI, salty food preference, physical activity, hypertension, gender, and history of cardiovascular disease or stroke. Our study shows that decision tree analyses can be applied to screen individuals for early diabetes risk without the need for invasive tests. This procedure will be particularly useful in developing regions with high epidemiological risk and poor socioeconomic status, and enable clinical practitioners to rapidly screen patients for increased risk of diabetes. The key features in the tree structure could further facilitate diabetes prevention through targeted community interventions, which can potentially improve early diabetes diagnosis and reduce burdens on the healthcare system. In this study, we employed data mining and machine learning to examine the performance of five classifiers (J48, AdaboostM1, SMO, Bayes Net, and Naïve Bayes) and nine non-invasive and easily obtained clinical features (age, gender, BMI, hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work stress, and salty food preference) for the rapid and accurate identification of individuals with diabetes. The best classifier was trained with the decision tree generated by the J48 algorithm, which had accuracy?=?0.9503, precision?=?0.950, recall?=?0.950, F-measure?=?0.948, and AUC?=?0.964. The results indicate that this strategy successfully achieves accurate and rapid diabetes screening. This approach can be applied for non-invasive prediction of prediabetes and diabetes without the need for expensive lab tests. Thus, this test could be particularly useful in regions with high epidemiological risk and low socioeconomic status. Decision trees are powerful classification algorithms used in parallel with data mining methods. The first variable (root) in the tree is the most important factor, whereas consecutively distant variables further from the root are ranked in order as less important factors for data classification. This study shows that age is the most important attribute discriminating between those with and without diabetes. Age is followed by family history of diabetes, work stress, BMI, salty food preference, physical activity, hypertension, gender, and history of cardiovascular disease or stroke. These results are consistent with those reported in previous studies. The decision tree shows that family history of diabetes, work stress and BMI are the following important factors after age. The tree identified a subgroup of individuals [1457 patients (99%)] with age???49, without a family history of diabetes and BMI???25 that were normal cases. Another subgroup of individuals [98 patients (97%)] with age???49, with a family history of diabetes, BMI?>?25 that were identified as diabetes cases. A subgroup of individuals [85 patients (100%)] with age?>?49 and work stress high, with a family history of diabetes were identified as diabetes cases. These key features could facilitate diabetes prevention through community interventions. Several large-scale trials have demonstrated the benefits of preventing diabetes with targeted lifestyle interventions. By reducing these risk factors, would be rewarded as Therefore, patients who are at a high risk of developing diabetes could be targeted to reduce established risk factors and provide educational programs, which will reduce the public health burden and the number of undiagnosed individuals. A major strength of this study is that we used a real medical dataset of annual physical examinations from Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. All subjects were subjected to laboratory glucose tests to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes, so the results were more reliable than if the individuals were diagnosed by self-reporting. In 2014, Shengjing Hospital received the Stage Seven award from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society for successful implementation of electronic health records and rapid sharing of clinical information via standardized electronic transactions, data warehousing, and data continuity with the emergency department and other ambulatory care departments. Shengjing Hospital routinely collects and stores a large amount of data in the electronic hospital records. We used data mining, machine learning, and knowledge discovery capabilities to identify potential data patterns and specific features containing enough information to increase the accuracy of diabetes predictions. A large-scale study conducted in Iran compared different classification algorithms in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and demonstrated that it is therefore highly recommended that the choice and selection of features for data mining applications in disease diagnosis, be done by the help and advice of experts to obtain the best possible results. Artificial neural network is the most accurate method of classification with an accuracy of 97.18%. In the future, we will test the model and develop prediction models with more sensitivity and specificity. We will focus on applying similar methods in different populations using more data. When the amount of data increases, the results will be more robust. Our approach can be extended to larger databases that store more variables and risk factors related to diabetes. The results of these studies could provide novel evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies. Clinical researchers can help to establish new priorities for further analyses by diabetes."

The data were obtained from a database in a diabetes control system in Tabriz, Iran. The data included all people referred for diabetes screening between 2009 and 2011. The features considered as “Inputs” were: age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, family history of diabetes, and body mass index (BMI). Moreover, we used diagnosis as “Class”. We applied the “Decision Tree” technique and “J48” algorithm in the WEKA (3.6.10 version) software to develop the model. After data preprocessing and preparation, we used 22,398 records for data mining. The model precision to identify patients was 0.717. The age factor was placed in the root node of the tree as a result of higher information gain. The ROC curve indicates the model function in identification of patients and those individuals who are healthy. The curve indicates high capability of the model, especially in identification of the healthy persons. We developed a model using the decision tree for screening T2DM which did not require laboratory tests for T2DM diagnosis. T2DM is frequently undiagnosed until complications appear. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from among the 29.1 millions of US citizens who have diabetes, 8.1 million (27.8%) were undiagnosed in 2012. Nearly one-third of the patients with T2DM who were newly diagnosed were observed to have complications with microvascular nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The results and models of studies similar to this project can facilitate early detection of T2DM and the prevention of potential complications associated with late diagnosis. The results of this study are consistent with findings of Meng et al., who used the features of risk factors such as eating habits, physical activity, and so on for T2DM prediction. However, most studies reported higher amounts of evaluation measures of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. This was probably because of the features used in T2DM prediction. The features used in this study for T2DM prediction were indeed the same as those used in diabetes screening and recommended by most well-known authorities. Prior studies also have confirmed that these features are important predictor variables. These studies, which aimed to identify and score the main variables affecting the development of diabetes, identified age and BMI as the main predictor variables and blood pressure measure, family history of DM, and sex as the highest risk factor scores for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes. The Pima Indians dataset has been used widely for data mining on diabetes mellitus. Out of the nine features, two include plasma glucose and serum insulin. Findings from past studies based on the Pima Indians or other datasets reported prediction models with high accuracy levels. This was due to the inclusion of plasma glucose and serum insulin. Fauci believes that the diagnosis of endocrine diseases is not yet established using the symptoms instead, and diagnosis is made by measuring the hormone levels secreted or their target. The main diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is based on several techniques for measuring the plasma glucose or serum insulin level, confirming that the selection and application of the predictor features require further attention. Therefore, prior research, especially those that had employed features related to the main diagnosis of diabetes, have compared the capability of the data mining techniques and algorithms, and it was found that they were not to be considered in diabetes prediction or diagnosis. The current study tested the decision tree using real data and the features used in diabetes screening communicated by the Health Ministry of Iran to the health centers of the provinces and cities as defined diabetes risk factors so that the primary screening was performed by evaluating such features in those individuals who referred. The study demonstrated that the decision tree could be used in the screening and that it would help in patient screening by automating the screenings in the electronic systems."

Increasing the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has given rise to a global health burden and a concern among health service providers and health administrators. The current study aimed at developing and comparing some statistical models to identify the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. In this light, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVMs), and multiple logistic regression (MLR) models were applied, using demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics, on a sample of 9528 individuals from Mashhad City in Iran. This study has randomly selected 6654 (70%) cases for training and reserved the remaining 2874 (30%) cases for testing. The three methods were compared with the help of ROC curve.The prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes was 14% in our population. The ANN model had 78.7% accuracy, 63.1% sensitivity, and 81.2% specificity. Also, the values of these three parameters were 76.8%, 64.5%, and 78.9%, for SVM and 77.7%, 60.1%, and 80.5% for MLR. The area under the ROC curve was 0.71 for ANN, 0.73 for SVM, and 0.70 for MLR. Our findings showed that ANN performs better than the two models (SVM and MLR) and can be used effectively to identify the associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we developed and explored the effectiveness of three models of data mining, including ANN, MLR, and SVM, in order to identify some potential factors associated with type 2 diabetes in a large population consisted of 9582 subjects with and without diabetes. In line with the previous studies, our results indicated that ANN is better than MLR and SVM for identifying associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes. MLR, ANN, and SVM were applied on training data set, and all models were used for the evaluation of testing data set. Based on demographic and biochemical markers, our findings showed that the ANN model had a higher predictive accuracy in comparison to MLR and SVM models. The sensitivity and specificity are two important factors for the validity of a model; therefore, these two criteria were calculated for the three models. The results revealed that ANN model had more sensitivity and specificity than MLR model and less sensitivity than SVM, which are in agreement with the findings of Meng et al and Sedehi et al studies. Investigations have also suggested that ANN could give a better prediction value than MLR. Those studies have compared ANN and MLR models using demographic and anthropometric variables, but we have used biochemical parameters. Moreover, we found that in the ANN model, the family history of diabetes and hs-CRP had a more important role in the identification of individuals with type 2 diabetes, while in MLR model, family history of diabetes, TG and hs-CRP and in SVM model, the family history of diabetes, age, and hs-CRP play a key role in determining diabetes risk, showing that hs-CRP is an important and a common factor in three models for determining the individuals with type 2 diabetes A major strength of the present study is that it was performed in a large number of samples, thus providing a new insight to the application of ANN, MLR, and SVM for investigating new potential risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes in a representative sample of the Iranian population. However, future studies based on cohort studies are needed to give better estimates of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve for ANN. Although we determined and identified the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes through ANN, SVM, and MLR models using demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical factors of a large population, more investigations are required to assess the clinical applicability of these three models for evaluation of new risk factors of type 2 diabetes."

BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care 2021;9:e001889. doi: 10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001889",2021,"Clusters of people with type 2 diabetes in the general population: unsupervised machine learning approach using national surveys in Latin America and the Caribbean. We aimed to identify clusters of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to assess whether the frequency of these clusters was consistent across selected countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We analyzed 13 population-based national surveys in nine countries (n=8361). We used k-means to develop a clustering model; predictors were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), and T2DM family history. The training data set included all surveys, and the clusters were then predicted in each country-year data set. We used Euclidean distance, elbow and silhouette plots to select the optimal number of clusters and described each cluster according to the underlying predictors (mean and proportions). The optimal number of clusters was 4. Cluster 0 grouped more men and those with the highest mean SBP/DBP. Cluster 1 had the highest mean BMI and WC, as well as the largest proportion of T2DM family history. We observed the smallest values of all predictors in cluster 2. Cluster 3 had the highest mean age. When we reflected the four clusters in each country-year data set, a different distribution was observed. For example, cluster 3 was the most frequent in the training data set, and so it was in 7 out of 13 other country-year data sets. Using unsupervised machine learning algorithms, it was possible to cluster people with T2DM from the general population in LAC; clusters showed unique profiles that could be used to identify the underlying characteristics of the T2DM population in LAC. We developed an unsupervised machine learning model to cluster people with T2DM from the general population in nine countries in LAC. The optimal number of clusters was 4, each with unique features. One cluster grouped a higher proportion of men and those with high blood pressure; other clusters included people with high BMI, WC as well as high frequency of relatives with diabetes. The frequency of the clusters was not always consistent across country-year data sets. The cluster profile could reveal underlying risk factors in people with T2DM in the general population; patients in different clusters could need tailored management and prevention. Changes across time and countries could also reveal variations in the underlying risk factor profile in the population or changes in the health system capacity, for example better diagnosis and treatment coverage. We used machine learning methods previously applied only to individuals and not to large populations, thus advancing the field with a preliminary work that sets the foundations for the identification of potentially relevant T2DM groups in the general population in LAC benefitting from population-based national surveys. A mechanistic understanding of the etiology of each cluster is beyond the scope of this work; conversely, we aimed to identify and quantify data-driven clusters of patients with T2DM in the general population in LAC. However, we discuss the profile of each cluster, relate it to T2DM key features, and propose possible applications of these clusters. Cluster 0 and cluster 1 could represent two different groups of patients. Cluster 0 grouped most men and those with the highest mean blood pressure. People in this group could be at higher risk of cardiovascular events and may benefit from treatment or interventions to reduce and control blood pressure and possibly other associated conditions. On the other hand, cluster 1 groups three variables that are the cornerstone of T2DM diagnosis and prediction: high body weight and relatives with diabetes. People in this cluster could be at higher risk of not achieving optimal metabolic control or of T2DM-related complications. People in cluster 1 could benefit from thorough metabolic control, with weight reduction and close medication monitoring. Other hypotheses may imply time elapsed from diagnosis. If patients with a recent diagnosis were included in cluster 1, then T2DM would not have yet caused weight loss, unlike patients who have long-lasting undiagnosed and/or uncontrolled T2DM. Regardless of time of diagnosis, metabolic and weight control could be key interventions for people in this cluster. Cluster 2 showed the smallest or the second to the last smallest levels in all predictors, except in relatives with diabetes. Patients in this group are likely to have controlled T2DM, with weight and blood pressure apparently in optimal ranges. Nonetheless, they had the second largest frequency of relatives with diabetes. People in this group could probably benefit from family-based interventions. This could be beneficial for them, but also for other family members who have not been diagnosed with T2DM, for whom T2DM could be delayed or prevented. Cluster 3 showed all predictors almost in the middle of the distribution, except for age which mean was the highest in this cluster. People in this cluster are, perhaps, most likely to have had T2DM for a long time. They may have learned how to live responsibly with this disease while taking care of other concomitant conditions, such as weight control and blood pressure. They could benefit from regular check-ups to keep surveillance on medication and other risk factors.There seemed to be a heterogenous distribution of clusters across countries; that is, the characteristics and frequency of clusters were not identical between countries. This could signal different profiles of people with T2DM in these countries and different distributions of underlying risk factors. Health system performance to prevent, diagnose and control T2DM could also potentially explain this finding. Nonetheless, we ought to keep in mind a key difference among the analyzed data sets: the age structure. This does not make all samples comparable. We did not restrict to a common age subset because we aimed to develop a clustering model that can use the full power of national population-based surveys, which are conducted periodically and with a consistent methodology; had we limited the study to the same age range, we would have lost sample size and included fewer countries, limiting the scope of our work. This work has successfully classified people with T2DM in four clusters at the general population level in selected LAC countries. We have proposed a hypothesis to explain the cluster configuration; based on these assumptions, we have also proposed interventions for each cluster. Nonetheless, given the study design (cross-sectional data analysis), it is impossible to study the long-term outcomes of the identified clusters. It is also impossible to study whether the proposed interventions for each cluster would have a positive effect on clinical outcomes. Future work, ideally multicountry cohorts in LAC, would need to elaborate on our work and study long-term outcomes. Currently, we provide data-driven clusters useful to identify groups of patients with T2DM in the general population in LAC, but this deserves further prospective research. This work analyzed population-based surveys to provide an overall picture of clusters of people with T2DM at the country level in LAC. In so doing, we found that it would be optimal to classify patients with T2DM in four clusters. We also found that the proportion of each cluster is not consistent across countries and years. This suggests that the characteristics of people with T2DM do not distribute equally in the selected countries. This has implications for regional and national interventions. First, regional guidelines and recommendations should secure that, when relevant and possible, interventions are tailored or can be adapted to the reality or profile of each country. The cluster patterns herein depicted suggest that people with T2DM do not always have the same underlying risk factor levels across countries and time. Second, when countries adopt successful T2DM interventions from other countries, careful consideration is warranted to assess whether tailoring or adaptation is needed. It may be possible that a successful intervention in one country does not have the same impact in another, if the underlying profile of the patients is different. Finally, interventions should not be static and periodic assessment is needed to understand if the population still shows the same profiles, or conversely they need a new or updated intervention. We provided a potential tool for surveillance of groups of people with T2DM in the general population. If we have four clusters and in 2015, 30% of the T2DM population in country X belonged to cluster 0, 20% to cluster 1, 40% to cluster 2, and 10% to cluster 3. This would give an idea of the overall underlying profile of people with T2DM. If cluster 2 was characterized by poor metabolic control, then we would need to improve this. If we repeat the analysis in 2020, the frequency of these clusters could change to the following: cluster 0 with 70%, cluster 1 with 15%, cluster 2 with 10% and cluster 3 with 5%. Then, this would give evidence that in the last 5?years something in the population has changed (this would need further investigation), because the T2DM population is now -in 2020- pronominally in cluster 0. If cluster 0 was characterized by high obesity rates, then this would suggest that we need to secure better weight management or introduce other food policies. We used national surveys, which account for an overall good representation of the general population in the selected LAC countries. Our inclusion criteria for T2DM accounted for known and Unknown T2DM, providing evidence for the overall T2DM population while maximizing the study sample. However, limitations need to be acknowledged too. First, despite using national surveys, we analyzed a small sample size. This was because we only studied people with T2DM, rather than the whole population. Our results could be verified with a larger sample of people with T2DM, although it is unlikely to find such sample with a national scope. Second, T2DM status was based on self-reported diagnosis or glucose tests. It could be argued that other biomarkers (e.g., hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) could provide better diagnosis or could be complementary. Conducting more sophisticated blood tests is challenging, not to mention expensive, in large random population-based samples, particularly in national surveys. Even if other tests were available, we would have diagnosed few more cases; we argue that this would not have substantially changed our results. Third, other variables, for example HbA1c or microvascular/macrovascular complications, were not available in all national surveys, so further analysis by metabolic control or T2DM-related complications could not be conducted. Nonetheless, this limitation further supports our argument to use simple variables to provide evidence for the general population, and not only more sophisticated markers that may not be always available in large national surveys, which can inform public health interventions. Fourth, the surveys we analyzed had different age structures; for example, some studied people younger than 65 years and others included older individuals. In that sense, comparisons across countries need to be made cautiously and consider these differences. We did not restrict the samples to the same age range because (1) we aimed to maximize sample size and the number of available surveys, hence the number of countries; and (2) we aimed to develop a model that would benefit from, and could be applied to, available national surveys which are conducted periodically and following the same methodology. If we had developed a model for a subsample, then the full power of a national data set would not have been used. Data maximization is paramount for machine learning research. Fifth, we did not compare our models with others available in the literature. A head-to-head comparison with other models was beyond the scope of this work because we targeted a different population and had a different rationale for our work. Previous models aimed to precisely classify individual patients based on clinical or sophisticated predictors and to understand what outcomes they were most likely to experience. Conversely, we targeted the general population and aimed to identify clusters of patients, from the general population, based on simple variables that are available in large national surveys (e.g., weight, height and blood pressure). Available models have a strong place in clinical medicine, while we hope our work can inform population health efforts to identify, quantify and monitor clusters of patients with T2DM in the general population. Sixth, because of the nature of the data herein analyzed—national population-based surveys—we could not look into long-term outcomes, like studies with a reduced sample and more sophisticated predictors have done. Our work complement this stronger evidence by suggesting that machine learning clustering analysis could also provide relevant information applied to larger national surveys. Future work should elaborate on the long-term outcomes based on the clusters herein developed. Seventh, the analyzed data were collected in different years, which could have introduced time bias. We do not consider this a serious limitation to our results because we aimed to provide a broad picture for the region in a wide (~10 years) time frame. Eighth, because we converged several data sets from countries in LAC, we believe our models could be applied to other countries not herein studied; however, extrapolation to other world regions would require further verification and cautious interpretation. Eighth, although we acknowledge that sex is an important variable in T2DM epidemiology, our clustering model included sex as a predictor rather than conducting the analysis stratified by sex. However, when we verified our clusters stratified by sex, the cluster configuration and the relative proportion of each cluster were very similar between men and women, as well as in comparison with the overall results herein presented. Small noted differences are most likely due to a misbalance of sex."

International journal of molecular sciences, 24(7), 6775. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24076775",2023,"Machine Learning as a Support for the Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. Among the main types of diabetes, type 2 is the most common. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent or delay the onset of complications. Previous studies examined the application of machine learning techniques for prediction of the pathology, and here an artificial neural network shows very promising results as a possible valuable aid in the management and prevention of diabetes. Additionally, its superior ability for long-term predictions makes it an ideal choice for this field of study. We utilized machine learning methods to uncover previously undiscovered associations between an individual’s health status and the development of type 2 diabetes, with the goal of accurately predicting its onset or determining the individual’s risk level. Our study employed a binary classifier, trained on scratch, to identify potential nonlinear relationships between the onset of type 2 diabetes and a set of parameters obtained from patient measurements. Three datasets were utilized, i.e., the National Center for Health Statistics’ (NHANES) biennial survey, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV. These datasets were then combined to create a single dataset with the same number of individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. Since the dataset was balanced, the primary evaluation metric for the model was accuracy. The outcomes of this study were encouraging, with the model achieving accuracy levels of up to 86% and a ROC AUC value of 0.934. Further investigation is needed to improve the reliability of the model by considering multiple measurements from the same patient over time. Many efforts are oriented towards improvements in diabetes prevention, diagnosis, and care. Applications of AI methods are the most advanced approach based on computational resources. Data obtained by clinical studies should be opportunely integrated within AI approaches, as well as information from investigations at the molecular and cellular levels. As an example, the role of parameters used in our work as features is the object of studies reported in the literature, and novel biomarkers for the evaluation of diabetes and diabetes-related complications could be added in the future, as evidenced by studies on the role of erythrocytes.
Since the numerousness of the data is a crucial point in representing a given phenomenon, our work has focused on being able to construct a dataset with large, high-quality data. A well-designed dataset is essential for the success of training and evaluating neural networks, as the quality and representativeness of the data will significantly impact the performance of the network. We used three public datasets to extract data, to introduce heterogeneity into the data. Data extracted were preprocessed to remove data with missing values for the features of interest, obtaining a final dataset of 13,687 individuals, i.e., with a similar number of individuals with and without T2DM. In this way, we obtained a balanced dataset with suitable numerousness. The features were selected for the evidence of relationships to T2DM and for the ease of obtaining them, being measurements of common practice.
We decided not to apply any data augmentation techniques, to preserve the quality of the information, which is fundamental for machine learning algorithms as they search for correlations within the data; all rows with implausible or missing values for at least one characteristic were eliminated. The use of a dataset of at least 13,000 samples represents the first step towards models with performances that increasingly represent their true capabilities on unknown data.
The use of a neural network as a machine learning model was chosen due to its ability to approximate any function with a high degree of precision. These models have been extensively used in the diagnosis of various diseases such as tuberculosis, malignant melanomas, and neuroblastomas. Furthermore, neural networks have shown the potential in enhancing predictive accuracy when the connections between variables are nonlinear or unknown. Studies have demonstrated that neural networks exhibit superior long-term predictive capabilities in bariatric surgery patients when compared to linear and logistic regression models.
Our study suggests that the model applied to the dataset generated can predict the T2DM state with very high performances, based on features chosen by the scientific literature.
The most significant features were blood glucose level, HDL level in the blood, diastolic blood pressure, gender, and weight, while triglycerides, age, BMI, and systolic blood pressure resulted less significant.
The ROC curve is a commonly used method for evaluating the performance of (binary) classification models. It uses a combination of the true positive rate (the percentage of correctly predicted positive examples, defined as recall) and the false positive rate (the percentage of incorrectly predicted negative examples) to obtain a snapshot of classification performance.
By analyzing ROC curves, one assesses the classifier’s ability to discern between, for example, a healthy and a sick population, by calculating the area under the ROC curve (Area Under Curve (AUC)). The AUC value, between 0 and 1, is equivalent to the probability that the result of the classifier applied to an individual randomly drawn from the sick group is higher than that obtained by applying it to an individual randomly drawn from the healthy group. The higher the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the better the classifier. A classifier with an AUC higher than 0.5 is better than a random classifier. If the AUC is less than 0.5, then there is something wrong with the model. A perfect model would have an AUC of 1. ROC curves are widely used because they are relatively simple to understand, capture more than one aspect of classification (taking into account both false positives and false negatives), and allow for visual and low-effort comparisons of the performance of different types of models. In our study, the calculated ROC AUC value is 0.934. This value suggests a high predictive value for the method developed. To verify that the heterogeneity of ethnicity does not bias the final results, we performed an analysis for each ethnic group, obtaining very similar results. As can be seen from, the best single neural network (SGD) and the ensemble predictions appear to be calibrated, thus interpretable as probabilities of membership in one class or the other. This is also confirmed by the Brier score, whose extremely low values give us confidence about the accuracy of the predictions in probabilistic terms. The calibration of the models must be checked carefully because faulty calibration might result in bad decisions, and reporting both is crucial for prediction models."

Predicting long-term type 2 diabetes with support vector machine using oral glucose tolerance test. PloS one, 14(12), e0219636. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219636",2019,"Predicting long-term type 2 diabetes with support vector machine using oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is a large healthcare burden worldwide. There is substantial evidence that lifestyle modifications and drug intervention can prevent diabetes, therefore, an early identification of high risk individuals is important to design targeted prevention strategies. In this paper, we present an automatic tool that uses machine learning techniques to predict the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data generated from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used to develop a predictive model based on the support vector machine (SVM). We trained and validated the models using the OGTT and demographic data of 1,492 healthy individuals collected during the San Antonio Heart Study. This study collected plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before glucose intake and at three time-points thereafter (30, 60 and 120 min). Furthermore, personal information such as age, ethnicity and body-mass index was also a part of the data-set. Using 11 OGTT measurements, we have deduced 61 features, which are then assigned a rank and the top ten features are shortlisted using minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection algorithm. All possible combinations of the 10 best ranked features were used to generate SVM based prediction models. This research shows that an individual’s plasma glucose levels, and the information derived therefrom have the strongest predictive performance for the future development of T2DM. Significantly, insulin and demographic features do not provide additional performance improvement for diabetes prediction. The results of this work identify the parsimonious clinical data needed to be collected for an efficient prediction of T2DM. Our approach shows an average accuracy of 96.80% and a sensitivity of 80.09% obtained on a holdout set. The mRMR algorithm produces a sequential list of ten ranked features. Besides ethnicity (ranked fourth), all other features are notably derived from OGTT measurements. The list contains six features derived from plasma glucose concentrations, while only three features are deduced from insulin concentrations. In all the classification experiments, we aimed to maximise the ability to correctly predict the diabetic class without compromising the classifier accuracy. The bar plots show the g-mean of the sensitivity and specificity obtained from the linear and RBF kernels. For each number of features used, we selected the combination that generated the maximum g-mean. All the results presented here are averaged over 100 iterations of the respective classifiers. The g-mean obtained from the linear SVM ranges from 0.8711 to 0.8742. the addition of more features does not result in a substantial performance improvement. However, the maximum g-mean of the sensitivity and specificity is obtained when all 10 features are used. For the non-linear SVM with RBF kernel, the g-mean ranges from 0.8638 to 0.8903. The combination of the features namely, yields the maximum performance. Notably, all four features are derived from the plasma glucose concentrations. We note that the glucose derived features are ranked the highest during feature selection. Moreover, a combination of glucose only features generate the best SVM models when less than four features are used. The accuracy and sensitivity of the same feature combinations. The best model obtained using a combination of four glucose derived features and RBF kernel has an accuracy of 96.80%, and sensitivity of 80.09%.  Table presents a comparison of the generated SVM models to the results obtained in other studies using the SAHS data-set. We compared our results with the SADPM, in which a person’s age, gender, ethnicity, fasting glucose level, family history, blood pressure, and cholesterol level were used to construct a logistic regression. It is notable that the SADPM has the highest sensitivity (88.80%) however, the increased prediction performance comes along with a very low accuracy of 56.33%. a two-step approach was introduced that first used the SADPM risk score and then augmented it with the 1-hour plasma glucose concentration measured in the OGTT. This strategy resulted in an improved accuracy but the sensitivity dropped to 77.70%. In the SAHS data-set, the prevalence of IFG and IGT was 8.91% (133 instances) and 22.52% (336 instances) respectively. Out of the 399 subjects diagnosed with prediabetes showing IFG or IGT at the baseline, only 120 (30.08%) actually developed diabetes between the baseline and the follow-up. Furthermore, 120 (25.67%) subjects diagnosed with diabetes at the follow-up did not show any symptoms of either IGT or IFG at the baseline.Our investigation shows that features derived from insulin have less predictive value for T2DM as compared to glucose based features. Indices such as Matsuda and HOMA-IR that are commonly used to assess the insulin function, also did not yield high correlation with the future development of T2DM."

Decision tree-based modelling for identification of potential interactions between type 2 diabetes risk factors: a decade follow-up in a Middle East prospective cohort study. BMJ open, 6(12), e013336. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013336",2016,"Decision tree-based modelling for identification of potential interactions between type 2 diabetes risk factors: a decade follow-up in a Middle East prospective cohort study. The current study was undertaken for use of the decision tree (DT) method for development of different prediction models for incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and for exploring interactions between predictor variables in those models. A total of 6647 participants (43.4% men) aged >20?years, without T2D at baselines ((1999–2001) and (2002–2005)), were followed until 2012. 2 series of models (with and without 2-hour postchallenge plasma glucose (2h-PCPG)) were developed using 3 types of DT algorithms. The performances of the models were assessed using sensitivity, specificity, area under the ROC curve (AUC), geometric mean (G-Mean) and F-Measure. T2D was primary outcome which defined if fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was ?7?mmol/L or if the 2h-PCPG was ?11.1?mmol/L or if the participant was taking antidiabetic medication. During a median follow-up of 9.5?years, 729 new cases of T2D were identified. The Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST) algorithm had the highest sensitivity and G-Mean among all the models for men and women. The models that included 2h-PCPG had sensitivity and G-Mean of (78% and 0.75%) and (78% and 0.78%) for men and women, respectively. Both models achieved good discrimination power with AUC above 0.78. FPG, 2h-PCPG, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were the most important factors to incidence of T2D in both genders. Among men, those with an FPG?4.9?mmol/L and 2h-PCPG?7.7?mmol/L had the lowest risk, and those with an FPG>5.3?mmol/L and 2h-PCPG>4.4?mmol/L had the highest risk for T2D incidence. In women, those with an FPG?5.2?mmol/L and WHtR?0.55 had the lowest risk, and those with an FPG>5.2?mmol/L and WHtR>0.56 had the highest risk for T2D incidence. Education level was categorised to five levels as illiterate, 1–5 years, 6–12 years, 13–16 years and more than 16 years schooling. Marital status was categorised as single, married, widowed and divorced. A current smoker was defined as a person who smokes cigarettes daily or occasionally. Former smokers were defined as individuals who have smoked daily or occasionally and who had quit smoking. Passive smoking was defined as exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke in the home, at work or in other environments. A family history of premature cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was considered as any experience of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke or sudden cardiac arrest in first-degree relatives, if it occurred before 55 years of age in male relatives and before 65 years of age in female relatives. A history of CVD was defined as previous ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular accidents. A family history of diabetes (FHD) was defined as having T2D in first-degree relatives. On the basis of their self-reported levels of leisure time physical activity, participants were categorised into two groups in which ‘inactive’ means those doing exercise or labour less than three times a week or performing activities achieving lower than 600 MET. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was obtained as ([(2×diastolic)+systolic]/3).16 Pulse pressure was defined as SBP minus DBP. Participants were grouped into two categories based on participating in the lifestyle intervention. Women were categorised into three groups on the basis of their menstruation status: having normal menstrual cycle by taking medication, normal menopause, early menopause because of surgery or other reasons. Women were also categorised to six levels considering pregnancy prevention methods: use of hormonal contraceptive drugs, intrauterine devices (IUDs), using condoms, withdrawal method, tubectomy/vasectomy and not applicable. They were also categorised into two groups based on birth history, a history of hypertension and hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. Incidence of T2D (outcome variable) was defined based on an FPG?7.0 mmol/L or 2h-PCPG?11.1 mmol/L or taking antidiabetic medication in all phases of the study.17 Final data sets consisted of 6647 cases (3762 women) which included 54 and 44 primary predictor variables in women and men, respectively. Our study emphasises the utility of DT for exploring interactions between predictor variables. In this study, we used the three types of DT-based methods to provide insight into the factors that have an important role in the incidence of T2D and how these factors might interact to reveal specific subgroups. We used the more established and widely available algorithms to select the one with the best performance. Considering sensitivity and G-Mean, QUEST had the best performance in both men and women data sets. Although our study focused on exploration of interactions, DT models can be used for predicting the 9 years risk of developing T2D. Also, it is possible to identify who needs more or different treatments if we take interactions into account. Two sets of variables were used for DT development. In model (1), we used selected variables which included 2h-PCPG, and in model (2), we excluded the 2h-PCPG from the variables list. Results of QUEST showed that although four similar predictors had the highest power both in men and women, they had different interaction patterns in the two genders; for instance, women with WHtR?0.52 had a lower risk (26%) for T2D even with an FPG level of above 5.2 mmol/L. However, in men, the results showed that when FPG is >5.3 mmol/L, there was still 56% of T2D risk, even with a lowering of WHtR to below 0.45. A systematic review of existing evidences has shown that the mean of suggested cut-off values for WHtR in men and women, respectively, was 0.52 and 0.53 for incidence of T2D. However, the results of this study showed that the recommended cut-off of 0.52 for WHtR is not a safe value for decreasing the risk of T2D among men,since significant risk of T2D was observed among men with WHtR?0.45, as we pointed out above. Therefore, men with WHtR below 0.52 should not be given false assurances about their risk of incident T2D if their FPG level is >5.3 mmol/L. A review of current studies shows that being aged >40 years is a risk factor fordeveloping T2D. Theresults of our study show that age ?43 years is a risk factor for men who have an FPG level >5.3 mmol/L. Results from this study confirm previous findings about the FPG cut-off point, obtained using traditional methods; additionally, we found the FPG cut-off point for men and women separately. For instance, two published studies of TLGS have shown that individuals with FPG levels <5.1 mmol/L are very unlikely to develop T2D during 6 and 9 years follow-up. This study shows that among men with an FPG level <4.9 mmol/L, there is only 14% risk for T2D incidence within about 9 years. Another interesting finding of our study was the important role of MAP in incidence of T2D in men and women. There are very few studies assessing the role of MAP in T2D incidence. Based on some previous studies, hypertension has been recognised as a risk factor for incident T2D in various populations. The inter-related pathophysiology of hypertension and T2D is complex and not fully understood. Our study showed that an MAP of ?92 mm Hg is a risk factor among men with an FPG>5.3 mmol/L even if WHtR is <0.49. In women, an MAP of ?97 mm Hg is a risk factor when WHtR is >0.66, even if the FPG level is ?5.2 mmol/L. These results imply that the co-occurrence of a high level of MAP and central obesity among women is a risk factor for T2D, whereas in men an increased level of FPG and MAP together is a risk factor for T2D. A simple point score system has recently been developed based on the TLGS database, including SBP, FHD, WHtR, TG/HDL-c and FPG as predictors; continuous variables such as FPG and WHtR were, however, categorised into three or four groups. In other words, the cut-off points were predefined for prediction of T2D. In our study, DT algorithms generated optimal cut-off points for these variables as they relate to the best classification of participants with and without T2D. Some strengths of this study include a large population-based sample. We used direct measurements of glucose value and anthropometric indices rather than self-reported information for both predictor variables and outcomes. Applying two variable selection methods with two evaluation criteria, missing data imputation and construction of DT models for both genders are other notable strengths. We have described the methodology in detail, allowing medical researchers to perform similar studies in different domains using DT methods. The limitation of this study is the 35% loss to follow-up rate, although a number of authors have proposed a value of 50–80% as an acceptable level of follow-up rates. In this study, we found statistically but not clinically important differences between the followed versus non-followed population in some baseline variables. The followed men had a higher value for the TC-to-HDL ratio, but lower age. In women, age, pulse pressure and MAP were lower for the followed population. Since these factors were associated with T2D, the results may be biased towards an underestimation of the association between these risk factors such as age and MAP and T2D. Additionally, we did not have data on dietary intake, which is an important factor in T2D studies. Finally, the models need to be validated on an independent population considering the ethnic and racial variations in T2D incidence."

Genetic Risk Score Increased Discriminant Efficiency of Predictive Models for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using Machine Learning: Cohort Study. Frontiers in public health, 9, 606711. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.606711",2021,"Genetic Risk Score Increased Discriminant Efficiency of Predictive Models for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using Machine Learning: Cohort Study. Background: Previous studies have constructed prediction models for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but machine learning was rarely used and few focused on genetic prediction. This study aimed to establish an effective T2DM prediction tool and to further explore the potential of genetic risk scores (GRS) via various classifiers among rural adults. In this prospective study, the GRS for a total of 5,712 participants from the Henan Rural Cohort Study was calculated. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression was used to analyze the associations between GRS and T2DM. CPH, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) were used to establish prediction models, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and net reclassification index (NRI) were used to assess the discrimination ability of the models. The decision curve was plotted to determine the clinical-utility for prediction models. Compared with the individuals in the lowest quintile of the GRS, the HR (95% CI) was 2.06 (1.40 to 3.03) for those with the highest quintile of GRS (P trend < 0.05). Based on conventional predictors, the AUCs of the prediction model were 0.815, 0.816, 0.843, and 0.851 via CPH, ANN, RF, and GBM, respectively. Changes with the integration of GRS for CPH, ANN, RF, and GBM were 0.001, 0.002, 0.018, and 0.033, respectively. The reclassifications were significantly improved for all classifiers when adding GRS (NRI: 41.2% for CPH; 41.0% for ANN; 46.4% for ANN; 45.1% for GBM). Decision curve analysis indicated the clinical benefits of model combined GRS. The prediction model combined with GRS may provide incremental predictions of performance beyond conventional factors for T2DM, which demonstrated the potential clinical use of genetic markers to screen vulnerable populations. The present large-scale cohort study among a Chinese rural population calculated a GRS, assembling the information of 17 identified susceptible SNPs for T2DM, and evaluated their additional prediction performances by applying CPH and machine learning methods. In this study, a basic prediction model consisting of common conventional T2DM risk factors was established and showed impressive and robust performance using machine learning methods. With the addition of genetic information to the basic model, significant improvement was observed, which means more accurate classification for the patients and non-T2DM individuals. These results indicate that the use of genetic information might help promote the practical prevention of T2DM. Therefore, using a prediction tool with genetic information in diabetes screening could help select high-risk populations and enable interventions to prevent the disease. Our analysis of the prediction model selected five predictors (FPG, TG, WC, hypertension, and parental history of diabetes), had robust and considerable discrimination (AUC ?0.815 for all classifiers) and the AUC combined GRS came up to 0.851 based GBM. Compared with the established T2DM risk assessment tools, similar factors in the prediction model were found. One widely adopted incident T2DM risk engine was established by Wilson et al. based on the American population from Framingham Offspring Study. Applying FPG, TG, HDL-C, BMI, hypertension, and parental history of diabetes in prediction, the AUC of the model reached 0.85. Julia et al. updated the QDiabetes-2018 risk prediction algorithm and the AUC of the model was 0.878 for women and 0.855 for men. However, there were more than 10 predictors in this sophisticated risk prediction algorithm. For Chinese rural individuals, our prediction model using common conventional risk factors might be an effective and durable tool to distinguish T2DM patients and non-patients. As an aggregation to interpret genetic predisposition, the additional predictive value of GRS upon the basic model with only conventional factors was significantly considerable, especially using machine learning. Our results demonstrated that adding the genetic risk score of GRS caused an impressive and significant increase of AUC from 0.851 to 0.885, based on GBM. Notably, GRS accounted for the improved reclassification and the considerable NRIs were 41.2%, 41.0%, 46.4%, and 45.1% for CPH, ANN, RF, and GBM, respectively, which suggested that GRS helped correct risk stratification to screen adults at high risk for T2DM. Previous work also demonstrated the potential of GRS among people from Asia, the UK, and Finland. Genetic information offers subtler and more unique characters for each individual in T2DM prediction compared with common epidemiological data. The predicted value of the GRS and the clinical use of genetic markers warrants further larger-scale internationally-cooperative investigations. Machine learning classifiers in this analysis presented a higher performance compared with the classical CPH model, especially via GBM. Data mining methods, which interpret the nonlinear associations and high dimensional of a large number of variables without model assumption, might be appropriate as a useful and robust tool in T2DM risk prediction. Several studies have demonstrated that machine learning methods showed higher predictive performance in risk prediction. Accurate and robust prediction of genome data, which have complex traits and multivariate correlation, was also conducted using data mining methods in this analysis. Previous research indicates that this technology is effective in exploring the potential of genetic markers. The decision curve showed the higher net benefit of the model with GRS via GBM, which demonstrated the clinical utility of genetic information to promote decision-making for clinicians. In particular, ANN had a minor improvement in discrimination compared with CPH (differences < 0.005). However, higher AUCs were observed for RF and GBM models, which demonstrated the reproducible high performance of ensemble learning. The strengths of this study included our analysis in which the predictive value of GRSs was evaluated among 3-years follow-up Chinese rural adults. This approach might offer supplementary evidence of the clinical utility of hereditary information in Asia and resource-limited areas. Machine learning methods were also applied to derive predictive tools of T2DM and showed considerable and robust prediction performance to explore the potential of GRS compared with the classical statistical methods. Limitations included first, the fact that there were only 17 genetic loci of T2DM for GRS construction. Nevertheless, four classifiers were employed to explore the utility of GRS and the results were consistent. Second, there was no external cohort to validate the prediction model. In our analysis, however, a total of 30% of individuals were randomly selected to test the performance of the risk prediction models (test datasets). Finally, the participants in this study were from Chinese rural areas and future studies should expand into the population with different inherited-background and economic circumstances."

Use of Non-invasive Parameters and Machine-Learning Algorithms for Predicting Future Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Health Data From Kuwait. Frontiers in endocrinology, 10, 624. https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2019.00624",2019,"Use of Non-invasive Parameters and Machine-Learning Algorithms for Predicting Future Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Health Data From Kuwait. n recent decades, the Arab population has experienced an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), particularly within the Gulf Cooperation Council. In this context, early intervention programmes rely on an ability to identify individuals at risk of T2DM. We aimed to build prognostic models for the risk of T2DM in the Arab population using machine-learning algorithms vs. conventional logistic regression (LR) and simple non-invasive clinical markers over three different time scales (3, 5, and 7 years from the baseline). This retrospective cohort study used three models based on LR, k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), and support vector machines (SVM) with five-fold cross-validation. The models included the following baseline non-invasive parameters: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), pre-existing hypertension, family history of hypertension, and T2DM. This study was based on data from the Kuwait Health Network (KHN), which integrated primary health and hospital laboratory data into a single system. The study included 1,837 native Kuwaiti Arab individuals (equal proportion of men and women) with mean age as 59.5 ± 11.4 years. Among them, 647 developed T2DM within 7 years of the baseline non-invasive measurements.The discriminatory power of each model for classifying people at risk of T2DM within 3, 5, or 7 years and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined. Onset of T2DM at 3, 5, and 7 years.The k-NN machine-learning technique, which yielded AUC values of 0.83, 0.82, and 0.79 for 3-, 5-, and 7-year prediction horizons, respectively, outperformed the most commonly used LR method and other previously reported methods. Comparable results were achieved using the SVM and LR models with corresponding AUC values of (SVM: 0.73, LR: 0.74), (SVM: 0.68, LR: 0.72), and (SVM: 0.71, LR: 0.70) for 3-, 5-, and 7-year prediction horizons, respectively. For all models, the discriminatory power decreased as the prediction horizon increased from 3 to 7 years. Machine-learning techniques represent a useful addition to the commonly reported LR technique. Our prognostic models for the future risk of T2DM could be used to plan and implement early prevention programmes for at risk groups in the Arab population. As noted, Arab countries have seen increase in the incidence rates of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in recent decades. Accordingly, tools that can be used to accurately identify high-risk individuals as targets for early intervention and prevention programmes are urgently needed. In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed a data set from native Arab individuals who were predominantly middle-aged and older and among whom more than half were either obese or very obese. We demonstrated that prognostic models developed using six non-intrusive parameters (baseline age, BMI, family histories of diabetes and hypertension, pre-existing hypertension, and sex) could identify patients at a high risk of developing T2DM within 3–7 years. In our study, the k-NN machine-learning technique outperformed the most commonly used LR, as well as another tested model based on SVM. For all models, however, the discriminatory power decreased as the prediction horizon increased. Table 5 lists the previously published T2DM risk assessment tools and classification models developed using non-invasive parameters. These studies, which were mostly based on LR models, yielded AUC discrimination values of 0.76–0.78, which were lower than the values obtained with our k-NN models (0.79–0.83) but higher than the values obtained with our LR (0.70–0.74) and SVM models (0.70–0.73). We note that all previously reported studies included lifestyle data (e.g., smoking, physical activity, diet, and medication) in addition to the standard non-invasive parameters used in our models. Accordingly, our newly developed k-NN model outperformed these reported studies. he uses of tools such as the presented models are two-fold. First, at the individiuals level, these models identify subjects at high risk for T2DM; such subjects can be targeted for prevention programmes that address issues such as awareness, fitness and nutrition. At the population level, the application of these programmes would greatly reduce the national economic burden associated with diabetes care, as these programmes are far less expensive than the treatment of diabetes and its complications. Second, patients identified as high-risk for developing T2DM comprise an interesting cohort from a research perspective. These patients can be monitored in the context of prevention programmes, using more detailed data (such as biochemical markers). Furthermore, these risk assessment tools can also be introduced to the public via online platforms, which would allow individuals to check their risk levels from the comfort of their homes. Such platforms could decrease the number of low-risk patients visiting healthcare facilities and increase the number of high-risk patients that might otherwise have remained ignorant of their risk status. These latter patients could then be invited to participate in a more detailed assessment based on invasive biomarkers. Interestingly, pre-existing condition of hypertension was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of developing diabetes in all the three prediction horizons though it is known that hypertension and diabetes are “concordant” disorders and represent parts of the overall identical pathophysiological risk profile; Positive family history of hypertension was associated with higher odds of developing diabetes in all the three prediction horizon. Positive family history of diabetes was associated with lower odds of developing diabetes in all the three prediction horizons, though the odds ratio was statistically significant only in the case of 7-year prediction horizon. In a similar manner, increased age at baseline was associated with a lesser risk of developing diabete; the study subjects were mostly from the higher risk group of late adulthood and old age (mean age of all participants at baseline was 59.5 ± 11.4 years) and the mean age at baseline was significantly higher for individuals who did not develop diabetes compared to that for individuals who developed diabetes within 7 years from study entry point (61.9 ± 10.8 vs. 54.92 ± 11.05; p < 0.001). The observed inverse association with age can be partly explained by the general observations (from literature) that in Kuwait the age of onset of T2DM is relatively low—for example, we have earlier reported the mean onset age for T2DM from a larger data set of Kuwaiti natives as 48.63 ± 12.12 years. As mentioned earlier, ROC is the standard technique used to measure test performance and to compare the performance among different models. However, to understand the clinical applicability of the developed models, reporting other performance metrics such as sensitivity and specificity is becoming necessary. Our work identified that the best value for sensitivity was obtained with SVM compared to the other two models (LR and k-NN) is only 44% and that if the prediction model is applied in clinical practice, it would mean than >50% of the cases will be missed. Though, the models are not readily usable for the clinical predictions, it is to be noted that the work illustrated that machine learning algorithms classify the subjects better than the logistic regression model. It is to be further noted that the models used only a small number of predictor variables (age, sex, BMI, family history of diabetes, pre-existing condition of hypertension, and family history of hypertension); making use of data (when available) on further predictor variables, such as on physical activity and lifestyle, in building the models is expected to improve the performance metrics. Our study featured a notable strength. While most reported diabetes risk assessment tools were based on LR, our study reported models based on machine-learning approaches, specifically the k-NN, with a consistently high discriminatory power. However, our study also had some limitations. First, the selection criteria of subjects for the study may cause bias in the dataset: (i) at baseline, the mean age of all participants was 59.5 ± 11.4 years, indicating that the study subjects are mostly from the higher risk group of late adulthood and old age who tend to seek medical care for pre-diabetes ailments. (ii) The subjects included in the study were required to have their BMI measurements recorded; physicians usually tend to check the BMI when they suspect obesity or other related ailments in the subjects; and hence the study subjects were already obese or over-weight leading to under-representation of normal-weight and lean subjects. Second, as up to 72% of the participants in this study had pre-existing hypertension at baseline, the study was limited by the absence of information regarding antihypertensive medication use; the observed higher prevalence of hypertension in the study subjects is not surprising as a large number of them were of late adulthood or old age and hypertension is prevalent in such an age group. Third, we did not have access to data regarding lifestyle factors, medication use, and other obesity indicators. Fourth, the models in this study did not account for variations in BMI that might occur during the interval from the date of the baseline measurement to the date of T2DM diagnosis, other changes (e.g., transition from non-hypertension to hypertension) or the administration of a new medication regimen or implementation of lifestyle modifications during the interim period. Fifth, extensive data quality assurance was missing. Finally, the predictive power of the models was not tested in the younger age group and was not validated in an external independent cohort."

We ascertain the importance of ethnicity (and natives vs expatriate migrants) and of using regional data in risk assessment. Retrospective cohort study. Four machine-learning techniques were used: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), multifactor dimensionality reduction and support vector machines. The study uses fivefold cross validation to obtain generalisation accuracies and errors. Kuwait Health Network (KHN) that integrates data from primary health centres and hospitals in Kuwait. 270?172 hospital visitors (of which, 89?858 are diabetic, 58?745 hypertensive and 30?522 comorbid) comprising Kuwaiti natives, Asian and Arab expatriates. Incident type 2 diabetes, hypertension and comorbidity. Classification accuracies of >85% (for diabetes) and >90% (for hypertension) are achieved using only simple non-laboratory-based parameters. Risk assessment tools based on k-NN classification models are able to assign ‘high’ risk to 75% of diabetic patients and to 94% of hypertensive patients. Only 5% of diabetic patients are seen assigned ‘low’ risk. Asian-specific models and assessments perform even better. Pathological conditions of diabetes in the general population or in hypertensive population and those of hypertension are modelled. Two-stage aggregate classification models and risk assessment tools, built combining both the component models on diabetes (or on hypertension), perform better than individual models.Data on diabetes, hypertension and comorbidity from the cosmopolitan State of Kuwait are available for the first time. This enabled us to apply four different case–control models to assess risks. These tools aid in the preliminary non-intrusive assessment of the population. Ethnicity is seen significant to the predictive models. Risk assessments need to be developed using regional data as we demonstrate the applicability of the American Diabetes Association online calculator on data from Kuwait. The applicability of machine-learning techniques to differentiate type 2 diabetics from non-diabetic population and hypertensive patients from non-hypertensive ones is examined. The models are trained with data on non-intrusive basic parameters from the nationwide Kuwait Health Network on diabetes and hypertension. Classification accuracy, which measures the proportion of true results, is used as measure of the performance of each of the models. Accuracy values of >85% for correctly classifying diabetics from non-diabetics, and of >90% for correctly classifying hypertensive from non-hypertensive population are possible with the classification models built using the SVM and k-NN. The developed k-NN classification models are adapted to build risk assessment tools that output ‘low’ risk, ‘borderline’ risk and ‘high’ risk. Up to 75% of diabetics are being grouped into ‘high’ risk, and as few as 5% of non-diabetic patients are grouped into ‘high’ risk category. With the Asian ethnicity-specific tool, it is even better with 88.4% of the diabetic patients grouped as ‘high’ risk. Up to 94% of the hypertensive patients are grouped into ‘high’ risk by the ethnicity-independent tools; with the Asian ethnicity-specific tool, it is even better with 97% of hypertensive patients being grouped as ‘high’ risk. Different pathology situations are modelled, namely diabetes in the general population (irrespective of the diagnosis for hypertension), diabetes in the hypertensive population, hypertension in the general population (irrespective of the diagnosis for diabetes) and hypertension in the diabetic population. Two-stage aggregate classification models, built combining both the models on diabetes or both the models on hypertension, perform far better than the individual models. Ethnicity-specific models and risk assessment tools are built using either Kuwaiti natives or Asian expatriates; the models that are specific to Asian expatriates are doing better than those specific to Kuwaiti natives. An examination of the performance of the ADA online risk assessment tool on data from Kuwait (natives and Asian expatriates) indicates that the ADA tool performs almost in a random manner in distinguishing diabetics from non-diabetics in Kuwait. This implies that it is important to build ‘local’ or ‘regional’ assessment tools using local data. LR models for diabetes identify hypertension diagnosis and family history of hypertension as significant predictors; in a similar fashion, the models for hypertension pick diabetes diagnosis and family history of diabetes as significant predictors. This is in agreement with the notion that disposition to diabetes increases the proneness to hypertension and vice versa. In this paper, we show that predictive models built using basic non-intrusive data are able to identify patients at high risk for diabetes and hypertension. This becomes useful when applied in a public health setting. It would be advantageous to use the tool as a preliminary step to identify patients at high risk and to direct them for treatment (and research) purposes. These models can also be made available online, where concerned individuals can check their risk at home by answering simple questions such as their ethnicity, BMI and family history of diabetes. Those with higher risk can be advised to contact a medical professional, while lower risk patients can be advised of simple lifestyle changes. Up to 20–24% of Kuwaiti non-diabetic patients are identified as ‘borderline’ risk with our model. Without publicly available risk assessment tools, these patients would go unnoticed. In the future, should more robust biochemical data be available, more advanced models can be built as a second step in our study. Those identified as high risk from the basic models could be invited to enter biomarker values for a more detailed assessment. Most of the available classification models and risk assessment tools for diabetes are based on LR. The presented study reports on the applicability of machine-learning approaches. Models based on SVMs and k-NN give consistently high classification accuracies. Prognostic measures (in terms of calibration and discrimination) help to evaluate validity of predictive models and to compare different published models. Discrimination describes the ability of the prediction model to distinguish patients at high risk of developing diabetes from those at low risk. We use the C-statistic to measure discrimination, and since continuous outputs are required to plot the ROC, we show discrimination values for LR and SVM only. On the other hand, calibration measures the ability of the model to correctly estimate the absolute risks,7 and we calculate it using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic for the LR (since calibration calculations require the output to be a probability). The discrimination C-statistic for the LR and SVM models (that we developed for diabetes in general population) are seen as 0.820 and 0.831, respectively. These values are in good comparison with those reported for similar published models (using basic non-intrusive parameters similar to the ones used by models presented in this study) that range from 0.74 to 0.84. The calibration p value for the presented LR model for diabetes in general population is evaluated as 0.135. A calibration p value of >0.05 means that the model is well calibrated, and a smaller value implies a poorly calibrated model.The major strengths of this study are as follows: (1) for the first time in Kuwait, large amounts of health and medical data are available for research. Because of this, we have plenty of data to model the disorders of diabetes, hypertension and comorbidity. This translates into robust classification models and risk assessment tools that have little uncertainty. (2) Most of the classification models and risk assessment tools for diabetes are based on LR. The presented study reports on the applicability of machine-learning approaches. Models based on SVMs and k-NN give consistently high classification accuracies. The limitations of the study are as mentioned earlier under Data section. We further add that we considered only those patients with complete data for the predictors used in the models; it is possible that patients with missing data have different risk profiles as compared with patients included. However, the missing data are most often due to the reason that the integration of data by Kuwait Health Network is partial and ongoing."

A population-based risk algorithm for the development of diabetes: development and validation of the Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT). Journal of epidemiology and community health, 65(7), 613–620. https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2009.102244",2011,"A population-based risk algorithm for the development of diabetes: development and validation of the Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT). National estimates of the upcoming diabetes epidemic are needed to understand the distribution of diabetes risk in the population and to inform health policy. To create and validate a population-based risk prediction tool for incident diabetes using commonly collected national survey data. With the use of a cohort design that links baseline risk factors to a validated population-based diabetes registry, a model (Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT)) was developed to predict 9-year risk for diabetes. The probability of developing diabetes was modelled using sex-specific Weibull survival functions for people >20?years of age without diabetes (N=19?861). The model was validated in two external cohorts in Ontario (N=26?465) and Manitoba (N=9899). Predictive accuracy and model performance were assessed by comparing observed diabetes rates with predicted estimates. Discrimination and calibration were measured using a C statistic and Hosmer–Lemeshow ?2 statistic (?2H–L). Predictive factors included were body mass index, age, ethnicity, hypertension, immigrant status, smoking, education status and heart disease. DPoRT showed good discrimination (C=0.77–0.80) and calibration (?2H–L <20) in both external validation cohorts. This algorithm can be used to estimate diabetes incidence and quantify the effect of interventions using routinely collected survey data. This study shows that diabetes risk can be accurately predicted at the population level using self-reported measures available in population health surveys. In addition to being able to effectively rank-order subjects from low to high risk, DPoRT-predicted rates closely agreed with observed rates across levels of risk for both sexes in two external validation cohorts. DPoRT represents a novel approach that can be integrated into commonly collected population health survey data. Similar to the clinical setting, where decisions are guided by estimation of baseline risk at the time of patient assessment, DPoRT allows estimation of baseline risk of diabetes using the current level of risk factors in the population. This approach has several advantages. Firstly, it has been widely accepted with demonstrated utility for clinical decision-making by providing an effective way to assess patient risk based on multiple risk factors. This risk assessment is then used to guide treatment or prevention recommendations. Secondly, there are well-described methods for developing clinical risk tools and assess their validity, providing a sound methodological basis to validate our approach. Thirdly, the use of simple self-reported risk factor data allows DPoRT to be used in population settings where detailed clinical data are often unavailable. Further, the use of regularly collected population surveys allows estimates to be updated frequently. The most stringent test of predictive model accuracy is the application of the model to a different population. This study shows that DPoRT is discriminating and accurate in two external populations that varied across geography and time. Previous studies that estimate future diabetes burden have either extrapolated overall trends in diabetes prevalence or indirectly incorporated information on the influence of risk factors with various assumptions. Studies of diabetes lifetime risk and life expectancy are not predictive; rather they describe diabetes from a life-course perspective using a period or stationary population approach. Although these approaches are useful, they do not enable users to directly and quantitatively assess the impact of risk factors, such as BMI, on future diabetes cases. Complex modelling and simulation methods differ from the approach used in this study in that they use additional information on how populations and risk factors change over time. A strength of simulation models is that they can combine different data sources. However, these models often represent clinical or theoretical populations, making estimates difficult to validate in populations that are meaningful for population health planning. Potentially important clinical values, such as fasting blood glucose, are excluded from DPoRT because they are not captured in population surveys. Although these variables may be clinically important, their use is not feasible for population risk assessment because they are not routinely collected in most populations. These omitted variables are unlikely to have a major effect on the performance characteristics of the model because of the clustering of risk factors, particularly when dealing with abnormalities of the metabolic system. A potential limitation of this study is that variables such as family history of diabetes or poor diet were not collected. These variables are also associated with the clustering of metabolic and other risk factors included in the algorithm. Using self-report measures is a limitation because these measures may be subject to reporting error. Validation studies have shown a strong correlation between measured height and weight; however, weight has been shown to be underestimated and height overestimated. It is important to note that DPoRT is designed to be applied to self-reported data, and, unless surveys or reporting patterns change, this is unlikely to affect model performance. There is evidence that simple clinical risk tools, including those with self-report data, perform as well as complex models. To ensure that DPoRT can be applied in different populations, we used variables that remained stable over time, were unlikely to be subject to serious measurement error (such as alcohol and dietary habits),and are easily captured using survey data in different populations. For example, physical activity, shown to have a protective effect on diabetes risk, was removed from the model because of the inability to capture it in a reliable and reproducible manner across surveys, as well as its lack of improvement of model accuracy. Despite considerable variable constraints, DPoRT maintained good discrimination. Additional predictive variables need to have a high independent risk (OR ?6.9) to result in significant improvements once a discrimination of 0.8 is already achieved. This phenomenon was corroborated in this study, as a maximum level of discrimination was achieved using few variables. DPoRT was developed in Canada and is most appropriate in the Canadian setting; however, like other risk tools, it may be transportable once validated and calibrated. The simplicity of the model and the fact that it was validated in two very different populations make its generalisability a genuine possibility. We recommend that, when this model is applied outside of Canada, it be validated to ensure accuracy. The use of physician-diagnosed diabetes, as opposed to true diabetes status (diagnosed plus undiagnosed), is a limitation because the estimates may exclude people with diabetes who are not yet identified. This may reflect patients with less severe disease and/or poorer access to medical care. Physician-diagnosed diabetes is currently the most commonly used definition of diabetes at the level of populations. Although true prevalence estimates would be higher, advocates of the physician-diagnosed outcome argue that it is meaningful to people with recognised diabetes and to the treatment of patients in the healthcare system. In Canada, all residents are covered under a universal health insurance plan and thus are eligible for healthcare and access to a physician for diabetes testing. If diabetes testing/screening increases over time, predicted estimates may be lower than the observed estimates (under the assumption of increased case detection). DPoRT has been found to be accurate in different populations for different time periods; however, it could be adjusted to predict total diabetes cases using information on screening/testing in the population. Curbing the diabetes epidemic has been identified by governments and health policy makers as a top priority for improving, and even maintaining, the health of their nations. Population-based prediction models such as DPoRT can be used to improve health planning, explore the effect of prevention strategies, and enhance understanding of distribution of the disease. This study shows that DPoRT accurately predicts diabetes incidence and is effective at predicting the population level of diabetes risk. This algorithm can be used by health planners to estimate diabetes incidence, to stratify the population by risk, and quantify the effect of interventions using routinely collected survey data. As the surveillance of risk factors and diabetes advances, DPoRT can be adapted to become more accurate, while maintaining its accessibility for decision makers."

International journal of environmental research and public health, 18(6), 3317. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063317",2021,"Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Based on Machine Learning Algorithm. Prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurrence allows a person at risk to take actions that can prevent onset or delay the progression of the disease. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict T2D occurrence in the following year (Y + 1) using variables in the current year (Y). The dataset for this study was collected at a private medical institute as electronic health records from 2013 to 2018. To construct the prediction model, key features were first selected using ANOVA tests, chi-squared tests, and recursive feature elimination methods. The resultant features were fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, triglycerides, BMI, gamma-GTP, age, uric acid, sex, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and family history. We then employed logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and ensemble machine learning algorithms based on these variables to predict the outcome as normal (non-diabetic), prediabetes, or diabetes. Based on the experimental results, the performance of the prediction model proved to be reasonably good at forecasting the occurrence of T2D in the Korean population. The model can provide clinicians and patients with valuable predictive information on the likelihood of developing T2D. The cross-validation (CV) results showed that the ensemble models had a superior performance to that of the single models. The CV performance of the prediction models was improved by incorporating more medical history from the dataset. This study proposed a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of T2D in the following year. While previous works in and developed a scheme for forecasting the occurrence of diabetes, this paper dealt with the possible transition among three classes: normal, prediabetes, and diabetes. Few studies have addressed the prediction of prediabetes, as most research has been focused on the prediction of undiagnosed diabetes. In this study, a large dataset and ensemble ML techniques were employed to develop the prediction models as compared to the studies mentioned above. Furthermore, the impact of the cumulated medical data on the prediction accuracy was also presented by changing the number of years used to train the models. A data-driven feature selection was employed to find predictors that were significant for detecting the distinct classes in the dataset. The resultant 12 features were FPG, HbA1c, triglycerides, BMI, gamma-GTP, age, uric acid, sex, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and family history. FPG and HbA1c were the most important predictors based on the information-gain criteria; they were followed by gamma-GTP, BMI, triglycerides, and age. Compared to using the traditional five predictors of T2D (FPG, HbA1c, BMI, age, and sex), the proposed models employing the selected features showed a superior prediction performance. When four years of data were utilized in training, the maximum CV accuracy was 81% for the selected features and 77% for the traditional features. It can be concluded that the additional seven features contributed to improved accuracy of prediction. We also note that in addition to the traditional predictors, clinicians must pay attention to the changes in gamma-GTP, uric acid, and triglycerides over the years. The study presented in reported the application of an ML model to identify the occurrence of prediabetes in advance. In their study, they have indicated the difficulties of predicting the prediabetes condition. The best accuracy presented was 69.9% for the KNHANES dataset. Our experimental results have shown a better prediction performance in predicting the occurrence of not only diabetes and normal but also the prediabetes condition too. The highest CV classification accuracy observed was 78% by using last year’s medical records as training data. However, the performance of the prediction model was improved by increasing the number of years to train the models. The study presented in reported a comparison of three data mining models for predicting diabetes or prediabetes by risk factors. The dataset for the study was collected from two communities in Guangzhou, China: 735 patients confirmed to have diabetes or prediabetes and 752 normal controls. The risk factors (predictors) used were age, family history of diabetes, marital status, education level, work stress, duration of sleep, physical activity, preference for salty food, gender, eating fish, drinking coffee, and body mass index. Three ML algorithms: logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and decision tree models were employed for predicting diabetes or prediabetes using the predictors. The decision tree model (C5.0) had the best classification accuracy (77.87%), followed by the logistic regression model (76.13%), and the ANN gave the lowest accuracy (73.23%). LR, RF, SVM, XGBoost, CIM, stacking classifier, and soft voting algorithms were utilized to generate the prediction models. Experimental results showed that the generated prediction models performed slightly better than the LR model, the existing statistical analysis method. However, the performance difference among the algorithms was negligible on the test data. This can be explained by class overlap in the feature space. The prediabetes class especially had a high degree of class overlap with normal and diabetes classes. The confusion matrix results confirmed that most of the prediction errors were from the prediabetes class. This lowered the overall performance of the prediction models and limited the maximum accuracy to 73%. The CV results showed a significant performance difference among the prediction models. The ensemble models (CIM, ST, and SV) had a superior CV performance to that of the single models including LR. The CV performance of the prediction models was improved by incorporating more medical history from the dataset. Overall, the results of the present study demonstrated that the generated prediction models performed better than the existing clinical screening model (LR). The application of the developed prediction models and findings of this study redound to the benefit of both clinicians and patients. The models can be used as viable support in clinical decision-making and patient counseling for practitioners. Furthermore, early prediction of the disease enables diabetes patients and those at risk for diabetes to take preventive measures that can delay the progression of the disease and its life-threatening complications. This study has certain limitations. First, FPG level was the only measurement that was used to define normal, prediabetes, and diabetes; HbA1c and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were not taken into consideration. However, the use of FPG level was consistent with the model developed. Second, in this study 10-fold cross-validation was utilized in the evaluation of the models. However, the development and validation of the models were conducted with only one dataset. Thus, it is compulsory to utilize additional data sources to verify the models derived in this study. Our study suggests two additional investigations that are worth pursuing. The first would be to incorporate diverse datasets to mitigate the difficulty of classifying prediabetes, which stems from the overlap with normal and diabetes classes. The second would be to increase the accessibility of the prediction models and improve the user experience for web and mobile applications."

Reverse Engineering and Evaluation of Prediction Models for Progression to Type 2 Diabetes: An Application of Machine Learning Using Electronic Health Records. Journal of diabetes science and technology, 10(1), 6–18. https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296815620200",2015,"Reverse Engineering and Evaluation of Prediction Models for Progression to Type 2 Diabetes: An Application of Machine Learning Using Electronic Health Records. Application of novel machine learning approaches to electronic health record (EHR) data could provide valuable insights into disease processes. We utilized this approach to build predictive models for progression to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using a novel analytical platform (Reverse Engineering and Forward Simulation [REFS]), we built prediction model ensembles for progression to prediabetes or T2D from an aggregated EHR data sample. REFS relies on a Bayesian scoring algorithm to explore a wide model space, and outputs a distribution of risk estimates from an ensemble of prediction models. We retrospectively followed 24 331 adults for transitions to prediabetes or T2D, 2007-2012. Accuracy of prediction models was assessed using an area under the curve (AUC) statistic, and validated in an independent data set. Our primary ensemble of models accurately predicted progression to T2D (AUC = 0.76), and was validated out of sample (AUC = 0.78). Models of progression to T2D consisted primarily of established risk factors (blood glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides, hypertension, lipid disorders, socioeconomic factors), whereas models of progression to prediabetes included novel factors (high-density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, body temperature; AUC = 0.70). We constructed accurate prediction models from EHR data using a hypothesis-free machine learning approach. Identification of established risk factors for T2D serves as proof of concept for this analytical approach, while novel factors selected by REFS represent emerging areas of T2D research. This methodology has potentially valuable downstream applications to personalized medicine and clinical research. Using a hypothesis-free machine learning ensemble approach, we have constructed a series of prediction models that identify the patient factors most associated with progression to T2D in real-world EHR data. Despite inherent noise that generally afflicts such data, predictive accuracy was relatively strong. The ensemble for progression from normoglycemia to T2D showed high predictive value in particular, and was replicated in the testing data set. Performance of our models was comparable to prediction models that have previously been reported (range, 0.71 to 0.88), though a validation study conducted by Abbasi et al suggested that nearly all models considered had overestimated T2D risk. Given the size of our data sample, we expect that accuracy would be stable across external data sets, though further validation is warranted. Although the REFS platform learns models directly from data without prespecified hypotheses, several patient factors considered to be established correlates of T2D were selected. Specifically, blood glucose measures, age, race, triglycerides, BMI, and blood pressure/hypertension have consistently been identified as risk factors for development of T2D, and were confirmed to varying degrees in our study. Identification of such factors serves to qualitatively validate both the analytical methods and the source data, while strengthening the body of evidence that these factors are mechanistically linked to diabetes progression. Conversely, other factors previously thought to associate with T2D were not replicated here. Some of these variables may not have been selected because they were not widely available (ie, family history, lifestyle factors); others may not have additional explanatory value once other factors are accounted for (ie, gender). We expect that more complete data on relevant covariates would further improve the accuracy of similar prediction models. In addition to established risk factors, relatively novel predictors were also identified, particularly in prediabetes models. First, HDL was consistently selected throughout progressive iterations of modeling. Although HDL only appeared in 19% of primary ensemble models for progression to prediabetes, results from survival analysis suggested a moderate inverse relationship between HDL and rate of progression to prediabetes, including a 24% slower rate of progression among those within the highest level of HDL versus the (gender-specific) lowest HDL category. This finding is consistent with emerging evidence for a role for HDL in diabetes pathophysiology, with several plausible mechanisms of action having been proposed. An association between the B1B1 Taq1B genotype, which leads to marked decrease in HDL levels, and T2D has been reported (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.12, 2.99). In a post hoc analysis of the ILLUMINATE trial, a lower proportion of participants on atorvastatin plus torcetrapib (a drug that elevates HDL levels) developed T2D, relative to those on atorvastatin alone. This difference was only marginally significant (P = .09), likely due to few events. Taken together, HDL represents an intriguing opportunity for identification of individual diabetes risk and for clinical intervention. Elevated ALT was also selected as a predictor of prediabetes, associated with a 19% faster rate of progression. A hepatic enzyme, ALT is used as a biomarker to assess severity of liver dysfunction, and some investigators have suggested a link with T2D. Vozarova et al reported a nearly 2-fold increased hazard of diabetes associated with the 90th versus 10th percentile of ALT (HR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.3). In a recent meta-analysis, investigators calculated a pooled adjusted relative risk of diabetes of 1.26 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.41) per standard deviation change in log-transformed ALT. However, after a statistical correction for publication bias was applied, this estimate became nonsignificant. Thus the role of ALT in diabetes is not yet established. ALT is a marker of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which has been associated with insulin resistance, therefore the connection is plausible. Our findings suggest that the magnitude of the effect of ALT may be low, and may be unique in having a large enough sample size to detect this association. Two other factors, CRP and body temperature, also emerged as predictors of prediabetes, although these measures were not consistently documented (6% and 11% respectively). CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation, may be elevated in obese individuals, and has been linked to T2D. Investigators in the Rotterdam Study reported a 67% increased hazard of T2D in individuals with elevated CRP, consistent with our findings (>3 vs <1 mg/dL, HR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.39, 1.90), and estimated that one-third of diabetes in the Dutch population may be attributable to CRP. Evidence for a mechanistic role of body temperature in diabetes is currently limited. A recent study in a rodent model demonstrated that direct injection of insulin into the hypothalamus resulted in dose-dependent increases in core body temperature. As progressive declines in insulin sensitivity lead to greater levels of circulating insulin, a link between diabetes pathophysiology and higher core body temperature is plausible. Further research is warranted to establish the clinical significance of CRP and body temperature in diabetes. Limitations of our study were primarily related to the availability of data. First, patients were not observed uniformly. Changes in status are not always recorded, and availability of clinical data itself may not be a random process. In some cases, variables that are likely to be associated with diabetes (ie, family history, smoking, adiposity measures) were not widely available in the data sample. For others (ie, BMI, CRP), available measures were not frequently updated. It is likely that a similar analysis in a more comprehensive data set would result in improved accuracy for resulting prediction models. Still, our prediction model ensembles performed strongly in an EHR sample that is representative of real-world clinical data. Last, interpretation of our baseline prediction models may be somewhat limited in that they were not designed to assume direct causality, and patient measures were not updated in follow-up. Although specific to diabetes, our study illustrates the value of applying machine learning to identify and characterize risk factors for health care outcomes from EHR data. These methods could be especially valuable in contexts where disease processes or interventions are not well established. Last, our method of real-world data-driven modeling could have an impact on health care by identifying at-risk patients early enough to present opportunities for prevention and clinical management. For example, in this report we closely examined 2 patients, and projected their individual risk profiles. Incorporation of personalized risk profiles such as these into standard clinical evaluation could have potential for increasing the specificity and success of targeted interventions."

Big data, 3 4, 277-87 .",2015,"Population-Level Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes From Claims Data and Analysis of Risk Factors. We present a new approach to population health, in which data-driven predictive models are learned for outcomes such as type 2 diabetes. Our approach enables risk assessment from readily available electronic claims data on large populations, without additional screening cost. Proposed model uncovers early and late-stage risk factors. Using administrative claims, pharmacy records, healthcare utilization, and laboratory results of 4.1 million individuals between 2005 and 2009, an initial set of 42,000 variables were derived that together describe the full health status and history of every individual. Machine learning was then used to methodically enhance predictive variable set and fit models predicting onset of type 2 diabetes in 2009–2011, 2010–2012, and 2011–2013. We compared the enhanced model with a parsimonious model consisting of known diabetes risk factors in a real-world environment, where missing values are common and prevalent. Furthermore, we analyzed novel and known risk factors emerging from the model at different age groups at different stages before the onset. Parsimonious model using 21 classic diabetes risk factors resulted in area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.75 for diabetes prediction within a 2-year window following the baseline. The enhanced model increased the AUC to 0.80, with about 900 variables selected as predictive (p?<?0.0001 for differences between AUCs). Similar improvements were observed for models predicting diabetes onset 1–3 years and 2–4 years after baseline. The enhanced model improved positive predictive value by at least 50% and identified novel surrogate risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as chronic liver disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.71), high alanine aminotransferase (OR 2.26), esophageal reflux (OR 1.85), and history of acute bronchitis (OR 1.45). Liver risk factors emerge later in the process of diabetes development compared with obesity-related factors such as hypertension and high hemoglobin A1c. In conclusion, population-level risk prediction for type 2 diabetes using readily available administrative data is feasible and has better prediction performance than classical diabetes risk prediction algorithms on very large populations with missing data. The new model enables intervention allocation at national scale quickly and accurately and recovers potentially novel risk factors at different stages before the disease onset. Related work on machine learning and data mining for early detection of type 2 diabetes can be categorized into three groups. The first group of related works uses the classic clinical diabetes risk prediction studies, which focus on large cohorts, but rely on small feature sets and logistic regression models. Our parsimonious baseline is based on these models. The second group uses classical diabetes risk factors as features, but focuses on comparing machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines, CART, and decision trees to combine the features. These models do not consider the potential impact of using a broader set of features. In contrast, our work uses a broad, rich, set of features together with a linear model trained with L1-regularized logistic regression. Although it is beyond the scope of the current study to explore in detail, we found that this was better than or comparable with carefully tuned random forests, gradient-boosted decision trees, and neural networks on our dataset. The third group of related work considers a broader set of features, which can be utilized to predict outcomes such as heart failure and the occurrence of urgent care events and uncontrolled A1c for diabetic patients. These related works also use (variants of) logistic regression for predictive modeling. Our approach is related to this group in terms of the generalizability of the method to multiple outcomes. However, we focus on diabetes onset as the outcome and provide an in-depth analysis of the selected features. Moreover, we investigate differences in risk factors at multiple stages before the disease onset. The temporal aspect of the risk factors, both in terms of early or late risk factors, and also the temporal trends for variables such as laboratory measurements are less studied. Temporal features are often studied for a handful of variables at a time, whereas in our study, we utilize basic temporal patterns on all 1000 laboratory measurements. The present study is the largest study to date of early detection of type 2 diabetes, both in terms of cohort size and the number of variables considered. Model fitting and validation were conducted using more than 42,000 variables. Hundreds of variables were selected as predictive of future type 2 diabetes. We demonstrated that compared with using a parsimonious set of variables, using big data and machine learning improves PPVs by 67% and AUC by 6.6%. The resulting models are already deployed at Independence Blue Cross for the purpose of intervention allocation. Our risk models do not require additional tests, screening, or chart reviews beyond what is readily available in health records and administrative data. This allows our approach to scale to millions of beneficiaries on a regular schedule. The reported sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values for our models can provide guidance for intervention targeting. For focused high-cost interventions, our method is able to (with 37% positive predictive value compared with only 12% using the parsimonious baseline) select the most vulnerable. When the interventions are more scalable, they could be performed on the 10,000 most vulnerable individuals, with a sensitivity of 21.6% in a validation set of more than 220,000 beneficiaries compared with only 11.4% using traditional risk prediction methods. Our study is strengthened by a derived definition for diabetes, which was found to have a highly accurate definition of diabetes in our dataset. This is an important strength as prior studies of predictive modeling for diabetes have primarily relied on screening tests and clinical evaluation on specific clinical visits. Our models include both known risk factors for diabetes and less established risk factors, many of which are likely surrogates for established risk factors. Many of the strongest predictors in our models describe prediabetes or elements of the metabolic syndrome, including elevated HbA1c, high blood sugar, and hyperlipidemia. While obesity was found to be predictive of diabetes in our model, it was likely underreported in the insurance claims as only 6% of beneficiaries were documented as obese, despite 35% of the American population being defined as obese according to the CDC. As a result, some less traditional risk factors found in our models may be acting as partial surrogates for obesity and its risk on the development of diabetes. For instance, esophageal reflux, which is documented for 12.6% of our population, is known to have a high prevalence in obesity and may act as a surrogate for obesity in our data. Similarly, sleep apnea and markers of inflammation such as leukocytosis have known associations with metabolic syndrome. We also found other makers of cardiovascular disease, such as coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, and kidney disease, to be predictive of diabetes onset. Although these conditions may be complications of diabetes, they also may be risk factors or diagnosed before diabetes onset. A number of risk factors related to liver disease were included in the predictive model for diabetes, including elevated alanine aminotransferase and the presence of chronic liver disease Elevated liver function tests are early manifestations of insulin resistance and are detectable earlier than fasting glycemia. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease a well-documented association with both obesity and diabetes. Our method also selects hypothyroidism which has known causal effects for insulin resistance, as predictive. Our model also included a number of cardiopulmonary findings, including acute bronchitis, shortness of breath, and chest X-rays as predictive for diabetes. While we are unable to make any direct associated link, these factors may reflect association between cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure with subsequent diabetes or may point to an association that individuals with acute pulmonary conditions may be at risk for the development of diabetes. Our study has several limitations. First, there may be more missing data among beneficiaries who have only recently enrolled in the health insurance plan or who have little healthcare utilization, reducing the sensitivity of the model among these beneficiaries. A possible solution would be to complement the administrative data with data gathered by other sources, such as by mobile health applications. Second, the study population may not be representative of the whole of the United States as 80% of the studied population resides in the greater Philadelphia, which may contribute both demographic and behavioral bias. However, we emphasize that our models can be easily retrained with other insurance companies' or providers' data. Third, since our outcome is derived from clinical and utilization data, we are unable to determine if a person has existing, but undiagnosed and untreated, type 2 diabetes. Due to the lack of a true gold standard for diabetes in our population, we were unable to confirm the sensitivity of our diabetes definition. Fourth, our parsimonious model used obesity as a surrogate measure for BMI. We found that the obesity diagnosis was likely underreported in our dataset, which may have limited the accuracy of the parsimonious model. Nonetheless, such limitations are common in claims datasets and highlight why previous models may not always be practical for population-level risk assessment."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, especially in developed nations. In recent years, it has become rampant in the developing nations such as Nigeria, posing more threats to individuals in the latter than those in the former. More than 415 million people were reported to suffer from DM worldwide as of 2015, with type 2 of the disease accounting for approximately 90% of the cases. The number of people with DM is expected to rise to 592 million by the year 2035. Therefore, DM is one of the growing public health concerns in Nigeria. In this study, the diagnostic dataset of DM type 2 was collected from the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano, and used to develop predictive supervised machine learning models based on logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive Bayes and gradient booting algorithms. The random forest predictive learning-based model appeared to be one of the best developed models with 88.76% in terms of accuracy; however, in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve, random forest and gradient booting predictive learning-based models were found to be the best predictive learning models with 86.28% predictive ability, respectively. n this study, predictive learning models for DM type 2 based on logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive Bayes, and gradient booting algorithms were developed. The performance evaluation in terms of accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of each developed model was determined. In terms of accuracy, the random forest predictive learning-based model happened to be the best model with an accuracy of 88.76%, followed by the gradient booting-based model with an accuracy of 86.76%, the support vector machine-based model with an accuracy of 85.29%, the K-nearest neighbor-based model with an accuracy of 82.35%, the logistic regression-based model with an accuracy of 80.88%, and lastly the naive Bayes-based model with an accuracy of 77.94%. However, in terms of the receiver operating characteristic curve, the random forest and gradient booting happened to be the best predictive models with an 86.28% predictive ability, respectively, followed by the support vector machine-based predictive model with 84.74%, the K-nearest neighbor-based predictive model with 81.94%, the logistic regression-based predictive model with 80.73%, and the naive Bayes-based predictive model with 77.73%. Figure 8 shows the results of the performance evaluation in terms of accuracy and ROC in each predictive model. Figure 9 shows the visualization of the random tree predictive model, which happened to be the best models in terms of accuracy and one of the best in terms of ROC. The predictive model in the figure shows that the glucose dataset attribute appeared to be the first splitting attribute and that the attribute is the most important for the diagnosis of DM type 2 in patients. This also corroborates the strong positive correlational coefficient relationship found between glucose attributes against the diagnosis result attribute of the dataset in the correlation coefficient analysis carried out earlier in the study. A set of rules that can be used for the diagnosis and prediction of DM type 2 can be extracted from the figure, which shows the visualization of the random tree predictive model. "

Ethiopia has been challenged by the growing magnitude of diabetes in general and type-2 diabetes in particular. Knowledge extraction from stored dataset can be an important base for better decision on diabetes rapid diagnosis, suggestive on prediction for early intervention. Thus, this study was addressed these problem by application of supervised machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction of type 2 diabetes disease status and might provide context-specific information to program planners and policy makers so that, priority will be given to the more affected groups. To apply supervised machine learning algorithms; compare these algorithms and select the best algorithm based on their performance for classification and prediction of type-2 diabetic disease status (positive or negative) in public hospitals of Afar regional state, Northeastern Ethiopia. This study was conducted at Afar regional state from February to June of 2021. Decision tree; pruned J 48, Artificial neural network, K-nearest neighbor, Support vector machine, Binary logistic regression, Random forest, and Naïve Bayes supervised machine learning algorithms were applied using secondary data from the medical database record review. A total of 2239 sample Dataset diagnosed for diabetes from 2012 to April 22/2020 (1523 with type-2 diabetes and 716 without type-2 diabetes) was checked for its completeness prior to analysis. For all algorithms, WEKA3.7 tool was used for analysis purposes. Moreover, all algorithms were compared based on their correctly classification rate, kappa statistics, confusion matrix, area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. From the seven major supervised machine learning algorithms, the best classification and prediction results were obtained from random forest [correctly classified rate (93.8%), kappa statistics (0.85), sensitivity (0.98), area under the curve (0.97) and confusion matrix (out of 454 actual positive prediction for 446)] which was followed by decision tree pruned J 48 [correctly classified rate (91.8%), kappa statistics (0.80), sensitivity (0.96), area under the curve (0.91) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive prediction for 438)] and k-nearest neighbor [correctly classified rate (89.8%), kappa statistics (0.76), sensitivity (0.92), area under the curve (0.88) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive prediction for 421)]. Random forest, Decision tree pruned J48 and k-nearest neighbor algorithms have better classification and prediction performance for classifying and predicting type-2 diabetes disease status. Therefore, based on this performance, random forest algorithm can be judged as suggestive and supportive for clinicians at the time of type-2 diabetes diagnosis. The study identified the prediction and classification accuracy of RF [correctly classified rate (93.8%), kappa statistics (0.85), sensitivity (0.98), AUC (0.97) and confusion matrix (out of 454 actual positive predict as positive for 446 of them)], DT pruned J48 [correctly classified rate (91.8%), kappa statistics (0.80), sensitivity (0.96), AUC (0.91) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive predict as positive for 438 of them)],K-NN [correctly classified rate (89.8%), kappa statistics (0.76), sensitivity (0.92), AUC (0.88) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive predict as positive for 421 of them)].Furthermore, prediction and classification accuracy were obtained from SVM [correctly classified rate (85.5%), kappa statistics (0.66), sensitivity (0.91), AUC (0.88) and confusion matrix (out of 454 actual positive predict as positive for 414 of them)], logistic regression [correctly classified rate (87.2%), kappa statistics (0.69), sensitivity (0.93), AUC (0.90) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive predict as positive for 424 of them)], ANN [correctly classified rate (88.8%), kappa statistics (0.74), sensitivity (0.92), AUC (0.90) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive predict as positive for 417 of them)] and naïve Bayes [correctly classified rate (86%), kappa statistics (0.68), sensitivity (0.89), AUC (0.88) and confusion matrices (out of 454 actual positive predict as positive for 407 of them)]. From the seven major supervised machine learning algorithms, the best classification and prediction result for type-2 diabetes disease status was obtained from RF classification and prediction algorithm 93.8%ofcorrectly classification capacity. In the WEKA tool, the percentage of accurately classified instances is called the accuracy of the classifying model. RF algorithm also shows an excellent prediction capacity at 100% accuracy on other studies conducted by Tejashri and his colleagues in 2015 at Wagholi, Pune, India and the study conducted by Naqvi and his colleagues in 2018 found that RF (accuracy of 89.3%)as the best technique for prediction of diabetes.On the other hand, the best accuracy of this study obtained from random forest (RF) (93.8%) is higher than the accuracy which was obtained from the previous study (85.9%) by Iyer and his collageus. This might be due to the number of input variables used because our study used seven input variables while the other study used only four variables (Plasma glucose concentration, BMI, DPF, and Age) as an input variable for classification and prediction of diabetes disease status.Based on their accuracy, this algorithm (RF) was followed by DT-pr-une-d J48 and k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithms at 91.8% and 89.8%, respectively. Another study carried out by Roobini and Lakshmi on 2018 showed that DT pruned J48 and K-NN accuracy of 91.72% and 91.14% respectively, which is consistent in accuracy with our research study.Basically Pruned J48 Tree is fast DT learning and it builds a DT based on the information gain or reducing the variance. It examines normalized information gain (difference in entropy) that results from choosing an attribute as a split point. The highest normalized IG is used at the root of the tree. The DT pruned J48 generate a tree contained 18 number of leaves with 35 size of tree that gets an accuracy of 91.8%. This help to extract certain rules and reduce the risk of over fitting on the training data. From this, variable age was obtained as a root node with the highest information gain (870.0/148.0) when age is?>=?36 year to be more likely tested positive for type-2 diabetes others as a leaves. This result is consistent with the result obtained from a study conducted by Amatul and his colleagues in 2017 from Indian diabetes dataset for prediction and classification of type-2 diabetes disease status which showed a diagnostic result of positive for type-2 diabetes disease was at the age of 40 years old.In addition, other rules which can be extracted from this schematic representation showed that age?>=?36 years which is the root node, DBP?>?81, FBSL?>?115, RBSL?>?211, sex?=?female and BMI?>?25 more likely to be predicted as tested positive for type 2 diabetes. Another study entitled as “Diagnosis of diabetes using classification mining techniques” which was conducted by Aiswarya and his colleagues showed that plasma glucose concentration as a root node. This difference may be due to this study considers both fasting and random glucose levels separately but the other study used in combination as a single variable. The other alternatives that have been used in this study for performance comparison were kappa statistics. From this kappa statistics that compares observed accuracy with expected accuracy (random chance) out of the seven supervised machine learning algorithms, it was higher in RF algorithm which was 0.85 and followed by DT pruned J48 (0.80) and K-NN (0.76).The value of kappa statistics of the second best algorithms (DT?=?0.80) is almost double of the value of kappa statistics of another study DT J48 algorithm which was 0.47. This inconsistent result might be due to the effect of pruning because pruning reduces the occurrence of events due to chance.The study conducted at United Arab Emirates in 2015 was found the higher kappa statistics result from naïve Bayes algorithm 0.50 followed by J48 DT which was 0.47. Normally, the value of kappa statistics ranges from ??1 up to?+?1, meaning the value 1 indicates perfect classification -1 indicates wrong classification, i.e., all the classifications are occurred due to chance. Based on this range, the result of this study obtained from random forest, DT, pruned J48, and K-NN for classification of type-2 diabetes disease status lies on excellent classification and prediction capacity. As can be seen from the result, in this study, the performance of the seven supervised machine learning algorithms was compared to their classification performance based on specificity, sensitivity, and area under ROC curve. For the testing dataset, the comparative analysis results demonstrated that the random forest DT pruned J48 and K-NN algorithms showed the best result of sensitivity of 98%, 96%and 92% respectively. On the base of specificity, the best result was observed in random forest, K-NN, and DT pruned J48 algorithms with 93%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. On the other hand, their area under the ROC curve showed that almost similar results ranging from (0.88–0.91) except the maximum ROC curve result obtained from random forest which is 0.97. Surprisingly, in all aspects of performance comparison criteria, random forest algorithm came out to be the best algorithm with a classification and prediction capacity based on its excellent performance of sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve. A similar result was obtained from another study conducted at Pakistan in 2018 by Naqvi and his colleagues with the highest sensitivity of random forest at 96.2%. In addition, a review paper reviewed by Chui and his colleagues in 2017 showed that RF algorithm had an excellent capacity on classification and prediction of type-2 diabetes at a ROC curve of 0.98, which was, exactly similar with our study. Another research work conducted on Classification of Diabetes patient by using Data Mining Techniques in 2018 by Nidhi and his colleagues showed that a better classification performance by DT J48 at 65.3% of sensitivity. This result is even lower than the true sensitivity of our result obtained from DT J48 algorithm which was 96% of sensitivity. This difference in prediction and classification performance may be due to the difference in sample size used for data mining and the attributes used to classify and predict type-2 diabetes disease status. In the previous study, they have been conducted on 768 instances with eight attributes where as in our research study we used 2239 samples with eight attributes. This indicated that an increase in sample size will lead to better classification and prediction capability of these supervised machine learning algorithms. From the result of confusion matrix which was conducted on 672 samples of testing dataset contained 454 actual positive and 218 actual negative for type-2 diabetes. On the basis of these evaluation criteria, the seven supervised machine learning algorithms, random forest and DT pruned J48 algorithms were revealed the highest prediction capacity on forecasting of true positive, i.e. out of 454 actual positive samples they predict 446 and 438 of them as positive respectively. On the other hand, the lowest prediction performance was obtained from the SVM algorithm out of 454 actual positive participants, it predicts to be tested positive only for 414 of them. This study result is consistent with the study conducted in Wagholi, Pune, India, in 2015 entitled as Data Mining Approach for Diagnosing Type-2 Diabetes status.This study was carried out using an appropriate methodological approach with sufficient amount of sample size for data mining. Methodologically, the study covered seven supervised machine learning algorithms (ANN, K-NN, Naïve Bayes, DT, pruned J48, logistic regression, RF, and SVM). The best three classifier and predictor models were selected for prediction of the upcoming new client for type-2 diabetes diagnosis. As a result, these points are considered as the strength of the study. On the other hand, this study was having the following limitations: firstly, since the study was conducted on secondary data, some of the important variables for classification and prediction of type-2 diabetic disease like glycated hemoglobin level were missed. The reason behind the removal of this important predictor variable is the occurrence of very few (only 2) diagnostic results recorded for this variable due to its expensiveness to perform the test. Secondly, while some of the record values of certain instances are missed; has been replaced with mean which affects the accuracy of prediction and classification performance, so that this also considered as limitation."

Diabetes has been recognized as a continuing health challenge for the twenty-first century, both in developed and developing countries including Bangladesh. The main objective of this study is to use machine learning (ML) based classifiers for automated detection and classification of diabetes. The diabetes dataset have taken from Bangladesh demographic and health survey, 2011 data having 1569 respondents are 127 diabetes. Two statistical tests as independent t for continuous and chi-square for categorical variables are used to determine the risk factors of diabetes. Six ML-based classifiers as support vector machine, random forest, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, k-nearest neighborhood, bagged classification and regression tree (Bagged CART) have been adopted to predict and classify of diabetes. Our findings show that 11 factors out of 15 factors are significantly associated with diabetes. Bagged CART provides the highest accuracy and area under the curve of 94.3% and 0.600. Bagged CART anticipates a very supportive computational resource for classification of diabetes and it would be very helpful to the doctors for making a decision to control diabetes disease in Bangladesh. In present study, ML-based classifiers have been adopted to the risk stratification of the patients into two classes as diabetes and non-diabetes. Independent t-test for continuous and chi square test for categorical factors have been used to select the associated significant factors of diabetes on the basis of p-value (p-value<005). Our findings show that 11 factors as type of place, electricity, wealth index, age, education, working status, smoking status, AC, take medicine, weight and BMI are the associated significant risk factors of diabetes. Moreover, six ML-based classifiers including SVM, RF, LDA, LR, k-NN, and Bagged CART have been adopted and performance of these classifiers are evaluated using ACC, Sen, Spec, PPV, NPV, FM, MCC and AUC. It is noted that Bagged CART based classifier provides the highest ACC of 94.3%. Finally, we conclude that Bagged CART based classifier anticipates a very supportive computational approach for detecting and classifying of diabetes with the highest performance score in Bangladesh. This study has few limitations as (i) the risk factors as family history, race, high-density lipoprotein, waist circumference and so on are not considered; (ii) risk factors may be changing now since study data are based on 2011 survey; (iii) only two statistical tests are used as t and chi-square as feature selection techniques."
